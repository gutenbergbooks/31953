<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<div class='cap'>WRITTEN largely between the shipping crisis of 1917 and the surrender
of German undersea arms at Harwich on November 20, 1918, this
book is an effort to record a seaman's impressions of the trial through
which the Merchants' Service has come in the war.</div>

<p>It is necessarily halting and incomplete. The extent of the subject is perhaps
beyond the safe traverse of a mariner's dead reckoning. Policies of governmental
control and of the economics of our management do not come within the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
scope of the book except as text to the diary of seafaring. Out at sea it is not
easy to keep the right proportions in forming an opinion of measures devised
on a grand scale, and of the operation of which we see only a small part. Our
slender thread of communication with longshore happenings is often broken,
and understanding is warped by conjecture.</p>

<p>In pride of his ancient trade, the seaman may perceive an importance and
vital instrumentality in the ships and their voyages that may not be so evident
to the landsman. By this is the mariner constantly impressed: that, without
the merchant's enterprise on the sea&mdash;the adventure of his finance, his ships, his
gear, his men&mdash;the armed and enlisted resources of the State could not have
prevailed in averting disaster and defeat.</p>

<p>The unique experiences of individual seamen&mdash;the trials of seafaring under
less favourable circumstances than was the writer's good fortune&mdash;the plaints
and grievances of our internal affairs&mdash;are but lightly sketched. Many brother
seamen may feel that the harassing and often despairing case of the average
tramp steamer has not adequately been dealt with; that&mdash;in "Outward Bound,"
as an instance&mdash;the writer presents a tranquil and idyllic picture which cannot be
accepted as typical. The bitter hardship of proceeding on a voyage under war
conditions, with the same small crew that was found inadequate in peace-time, is
hardly suggested; the extent of the work to be overtaken is perhaps camouflaged
in that description of setting out. Reality would more frequently show a vessel
being hurried out of dock on the top of the tide, putting to sea into heavy weather,
with the hatchways open over hasty stowage, and all the litter of a week's harbour
disroutine standing to be cleared by a raw and semi-mutinous crew.</p>

<p>Criticism on these grounds is just: but it was ever the seaman's custom to
dismiss heavy weather&mdash;when it was past and gone&mdash;and recall only the fine
days of smooth sailing. If the hard times of our strain and labouring are not
wholly over, at least we have fallen in with a more favouring wind from the
land. Conditions in the Merchants' Service are vastly improved since Germany
challenged our right to pass freely on our lawful occasions. Relations between
the owner and the seamen are less strained. Remuneration for sea-service is
now more adequate. The sullen atmosphere of harsh treatment on the one
hand, and grudging service on the other, has been cleared away by the hurricane
threat to our common interests.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE MERCHANTS' SERVICE</h3>


<h3><br />OUR FOUNDATION</h3>

<div class='cap'>ALTHOUGH sea-interest of to-day finds an expression somewhat trite and
familiar, the spell of the ships and the romance of voyaging drew an
instant and wondering recognition from the older chroniclers. With a
sure sense of right emphasis, yet observing an austere simplicity, they preserved
for us an eloquent and adequate impression of the vital power of the ships. One
outstanding fact remains constantly impressed in their records&mdash;that our island
gates are set fast on the limits of tide-mark, leaving no way out but by passage
of the misty sea-line; there is no gangway to a foreign field other than the
planking of our vessels.</div>

<p>Grandeur of the fleets, the might of sea-ordnance, the intense dramatic
decision of a landing, stand out in the great pieces the early writers and painters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
designed. Brave kingly figures wind in and out against the predominant background
of rude hulls and rigging and weathered sails. The outline of the ships
and the ungainly figures of the mariners are definitely placed to impel our
thoughts to the distant sea-marches.</p>

<p>Happily for us, the passengers of early days included clerks and learned men
on their pilgrimages, else we had known but little of bygone ship life. With
interest narrowed by bounds of the bulwarks, they noted and recorded a worthy
description. In the mystery of unknown seas, as in detail of the sea-tackle and
the forms and usages of the ship, they penned a perfect register: down to the
tunnage of the butts, we know the ships&mdash;to the 'goun of faldying' and the
extent of their lodemanage, we recognize the men.</p>

<p>At later date we come on the seaman and his ships recorded and portrayed
with a loving enthusiasm. Richard Hakluyt&mdash;"with great charges and infinite
cares, after many watchings, toiles and travels, and wearying out" of his weak
body&mdash;sets out for us a wonderful chronicle of the shipping to his day. He grew
familiarly acquainted with the chiefest 'Captaines,' the greatest merchants,
and the best mariners of our nation, and acquired at first hand somewhat more
than common knowledge of the sea. He saw not only the waving banners of
sea-warriors and the magnificence of their martial encounters, but lauded
victory in far voyages, the opening to commerce of distant lands, the hardihood
of the Merchant Venturers. He realized the value of the seaman to the nation,
not alone to fight battles on the sea, but as skilful navigators to further trade
and intercourse. He was not ignorant "that shippes are to litle purpose without
skillfull Sea-men; and since Sea-men are not bred up to perfection of skill in
much lesse time than in the time of two prentiships; and since no kinde of
men of any profession in the commonwealth passe their yeres in so great and
continuall hazard of life; and since of so many, so few grow to gray heires;
how needful it is that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. these ought to have a better education, than hitherto
they have had."</p>

<p>His matchless patience and care and exactitude were only equalled by
his pride in the doings of the seamen and the merchants. With a joyful humility
he exults in the hoisting of our banners in the Caspian Sea&mdash;not as robber
marauders, but as peaceful traders under licence and ambassade&mdash;at the station
of an English Ligier in the stately porch of the Grand Signior at Constantinople,
at consulates at Tripolis and Aleppo, in Babylon and Balsara&mdash;"and which is
more, at English Shippes coming to anker in the mighty river of Plate." In
script and tabulation he glories in the tale of the ships, and sets out the names
and stations of humble merchant supercargoes with the same meticulous care
as the rank and titles of the Captain-General of the Armada.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas! There was none to set a similarly gifted hand to the further course
of his lone furrow. Purchas tried, but there was no great love of his subject-matter
to spread a glamour on the pages. Perhaps the magnitude of the task,
ever growing and gathering, and the minute and unwearying succession of
Hakluyt's "Navigations and Traffiques," discouraged and deterred less ardent
followers. Of voyages and expeditions and discoveries there are volumes
enough, but few such intimate records as "the Oathe ministered to the servants
of the Muscovie company," or the instructions given by the Merchant Adventurers
unto Richard Gibbs, William Biggatt, and John Backhouse, masters of
their ships, have been written since Hakluyt turned his last page.</p>

<p>As outposts to our field, roving bands on a frontier that rises and falls with
the tide, the seamen were ever the first to apprehend the mutterings of war.
With but little needed to set spark to the torch, they came in to foreign seaport
or littoral with a fine confidence in their ships and arms. Truculent perhaps,
and overbearing in their pride of long voyaging over a mysterious and threatening
sea, they were hardly the ambassadors to aid settlement of a dispute by
frank goodwill and prudence. Sailing outwith the confines of ordered government,
their lawless outlook and freebooting found a ready rejoinder in restraint
of trade and arbitrary imprisonment. Long wars had their seed in tavern brawls,
enforcement "to stoope gallant [lower topsail] and vaile their bonets" for a
puissant king or queen, brought a reckoning of strife and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Although military sea-captains, the glory of their victories, the worthiness
of their ships and appurtenances, figure largely on the pages of subsequent sea-history,
not a great deal has been written of the sailor captains and their mates
and crews. Later chroniclers were concerned that their subjects should be
grand and combatant: there was little room in their text for trading ventures,
or for such humble recitals as the tale and values of hogshead or caisse or bale.
A line of demarcation was slowly but inevitably ruling a division of our sea-forces.
The service of the ships, devoted indifferently to sea-warfare or oversea
trading&mdash;as the nation might be at war or peace&mdash;was in process of adjustment
to meet the demands of a new sea-attack. The vessels were no longer merely
floating platforms from which a military leader could direct a plan of rude
assault and engage the arms of his soldiery, leaving to the masters and seamen
the duty of handling the way of the ship. A new aristocracy had arisen from
the decks who saw, in the pull of their sails, a weapon more powerful than shock
ordnance, and resented the dictation of landsmen on their own sea-province.
Sea-warfare had become a contest, more of seamanship and man&oelig;uvre, less of
stunning impact and a weight of military arms.</p>

<p>In division of the ships and their service, it may quite properly be claimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that the Merchants' Service remained the parent trunk from which the new
Navy&mdash;a gallant growing limb&mdash;drew sap and sustenance, perhaps, in turn,
improving the growth of the grand old tree. Certainly their service was an
offshoot, for, since Henry VIII ordered laying of the first especial war keel, the
sea-battles to the present day have been largely joined by the ships and men
and furniture of the merchants, carrying on in the historic traditional manner
of a fight when there was fighting to be done, a return to trade and enterprise
when the great sea-roads were cleared to commerce. Stout old Sir John Hawkins,
Frobisher, Drake, Davis, Amadas, and Barlow were merchant masters, shrewd
at a venture, in intervals of, and combination with, their deeds of arms. Only a
small proportion of State ships were in issue with the merchants' men to scourge
the great Armada from our shores. Perhaps the existence of such a vast reserve
in ships and men delayed the progress of purely naval construction. Only with
the coming of steam was the line drawn sharply and definitely&mdash;the branch
outgrowing the interlock of the parent stem.</p>

<p>With partial severance and division of the ships, the seamen&mdash;who had been
for so long of one breed, laying down sail-needle and caulking-iron to serve
ordnance and hand-cutlass or boarding-pike&mdash;had reached a parting of the ways,
and become naval or mercantile as their habits lay. The State war vessels,
built and manned and maintained for strictly military uses, increased in strength
and numbers. Their officers and crews developed a new seamanship and
discipline that had little counterpart on the commercial vessels. For a time
the two services sailed, if not in company, within sight and hail of one another.
On occasion they joined to effect glorious issues, but, with the last broadside
of war, courses were set that quickly swerved the fleets apart.</p>

<p>Longer terms of peace gave opportunity for development on lines that were
as poles apart. The Naval Service perfected and exercised their engines of war,
and drilled and seasoned their men to automaton-like subservience to their
plans. A broadening to democratic freedom, quickened by familiar intercourse
with other nationals, had effect with the merchantmen in rousing a reluctance
to a resort to arms; they desired but a free continuance of trading relations.
Although differing in their operations and ideals, both services were striving to
enhance the sea-power of the nation. Thomas Cavendish, Middleton, Monson,
Hudson, and Baffin&mdash;merchant masters&mdash;explored the unknown and extended
a field for mercantile ventures, but that field could have been but indifferently
maintained if naval power had not been advanced to protect the merchantmen
in their voyaging.</p>

<span class="caption">THE BRIDGE OF A MERCHANTMAN</span>
</div>

<p>As their separation developed, relations grew the more distant between the
seamen. While certainly protecting the traders from any foreign interference,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the new Navy did little to effect a community of interest with their sea-fellows.
Prejudices and distrust grew up. State jealousies and trade monopolies formed
a confusion of interests and made for strained relations between the merchants
and the naval chancelleries on shore. At sea, the arbitrary exercise of authority
by the King's officers was opposed by revolutionary instincts for a free sea on
the part of the merchants' seamen. Forcible impressment to naval service was
the worst that could befall the traders' men. For want of energy or ability to
carry through the drudgery of early sea-training, the naval officers took toll of
the practised commercial seamen as they came in from sea. Bitter hardship
set wedge to the cleavage. After long and perilous voyaging, absent from a
home port for perhaps two or three years, the homeward-bound sailor had little
chance of being allowed a term of liberty on shore&mdash;a brief landward turn to
dissolve the salt casing of his bones. Within sound of his own church bells, in
sight of the windmills and the fields and the home dwelling he had longed for,
he was haled to hard and rigorous sea-service on vessels of war. The records of
the East India Company have frequent references to this cruel exercise of naval
tyranny.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On Thursday morning the Directors received the agreeable news of the
safe arrival of the <i>Devonshire</i>, Captain Prince, from Bengal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Her men
have all been impressed by the Men-of-War in the Downs, and other hands
were put on board to bring her up to her moorings in the River."</p>

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On Sunday morning the Purser of the <i>William</i>, Captain Petre,
arrived in town, who brought advice of the said ship in the Downs, richly
laden, on Account of the Turkey Company: the Ships of War in the Downs
impressed all her men, and put others on board to bring her up."</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the Report spread about, fourteen days ago, that no
more sailors would be impressed out of the homeward-bound ships, several
ships that arrived last week had all their men taken from them in the Downs."</p></div>

<p>Serving by turns, as his agility to dodge the gangs was rated, on King's ship
for a turn, then hauling bowline on a free vessel; forced and hunted and
impressed, the shipmen had perhaps sorry records to offer the historian, then
busy with the enthralling chronicles of fleet engagements and veiling with
glamour the toll of battles. Perhaps it was, after all, the better course to preserve
a silence on the traders' doings and leave to romantic conjecture a continuance
of Hakluyt's patient story.</p>

<p>Since the date of naval offgrowth, the chronicles have not often turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
on our commercial path. Lone voyages and encounters with the sea and
storm are minor enterprises to the sack of cities and the clash of arms at
sea. Unlike the Naval Service, we merchants' men hold few recorded titles to
our keystone in the national fabric. The deeds and documents may exist, but
they are lost to us and forgotten in the files of musty ledgers. The fruits of
our efforts stand in the balances of commercial structure, and are perhaps more
enduring than a roll of record. But, if we are insistent in our search, we may
borrow from the naval charters, and read that not all the glory of our sea-history
lies with the thunder of broadsides and the impact of a close boarding.
Engagement with the elements&mdash;a contest with powers more cruel and implacable
than keen steel&mdash;efforts to further able navigation, the standard
of our seamanship&mdash;drew notable recruits to the humbler sea-life. The small
crews and less lavish gear on the freighters brought the essentials of the sea-trade
to each individual of the ship's company. Idlers and landsmen learned
quickly and bitterly that their only claim to existence on a merchant's ship lay
in a rapid acquisition of a skill in seamanship. The lessons and the threats
and enforcements did not come wholly from their superiors, to whose tyranny
they might expose a sullen obstinance, and gain, perhaps, a measure of sympathy
from their rude sea-fellows. Then&mdash;as later, in the keen sailing days of our
clipper ships&mdash;their hardest taskmasters were foremast hands, watchmates, the
men they lived with and ate with and worked with&mdash;bitter critics, unpersuadable,
who saw only menace and a threat to their own safety in the shipping of a man
who could not do man's work. On the decks and about the spars of a merchant
vessel, each man of the few seamen carried two lives&mdash;his own and a shipmate's&mdash;in
his ability to 'hand, reef, and steer.' There was no place on board for a
'waister,' a 'swabber,' longshoreman, or sea labourer. Every man had quickly
to prove his ability: the unrelenting sea gave time for few essays.</p>

<p>Fertility of resource, dexterity to serve at all duties, skill at handling ship
and canvas, were the results of sea-ship training. In the merchantmen great
opportunities offered for advancement in all branches of the seaman's art. Long
voyaging was better exercise for a progression in navigation than the daily
pilotage of the war vessels. Blake, in his early days as a merchant supercargo,
learnt his seafaring on rough trading voyages, and his training could not have
been other than sound to persist, through twenty years shore-dwelling as a
merchant at Bridgwater, until he was called from his counting-house to command
our naval forces. Dampier was a tarry foremast hand in his day: whatever
we may judge of his conduct, we can have nothing but admiration for his seamanship.
Ill-equipped and short-handed, racked by sea-sores and scurvy, his
expeditions were unparalleled as a triumph of merchant sea-skill. James Cook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
learned his trade on the grimy hull of an east-coast collier&mdash;to this day we are
working on charts of his masterly surveys.</p>

<p>In later years the merit of the trading vessels as sterling sea-schools was
equally plain. During intervals of combatant service, or as prelude to a naval
career, training on the merchants' ships was eagerly sought by ardent naval
seamen who saw the value of its resource in practical seamanship, in navigation,
and weather knowledge. Great captains did not disdain the measure of the
instruction. They sent their heirs to sea in trading vessels to draw an essence
in practice from their sea-cunning. Hardy, Foley, and Berry had borne a hand
at the sheets and braces, and had steered a lading of goods abroad, before they
came to high command of the King's ships. Who knows what actions in the
victories of Copenhagen, the Nile, and Trafalgar (hinged on the cast of the winds)
were governed by Nelson's early sea-lessons, under Master John Rathbone, on
the decks of a West India merchantman?</p>

<p>For long after, relations and interchange between the two Services were not
so intimate. Until coming of the Great War, with a mutual appreciation, we
had little in common. Our friend and peacemaker&mdash;the influence of seafaring
under square sail&mdash;languished a while, then died. In steam-power, with its
growth of development and intricacy of application, we found no worthy successor
to present as good an office. In the long span of a hundred years of sea-peace
we grew apart. The gulf between the two great Services widened to a breach
that only the rigours of a world-conflict could reconcile.</p>

<p>As though exhausted by the indefinite sea-campaign of 1812, the Royal
Navy lay on their oars and saw their commercial sea-fellows forge ahead on a
course that revolutionized sea-transport and sea-warfare alike. The Lords of
the Admiralty would listen to no deprecation of their gallant old wooden walls:
steam propulsion was laughed at. To the Merchants' Service they left the risk
and the responsibility of venturing afar in the rude new ships. In this wise,
to us fell the honour of leading the State service to a new order of seafaring.
Iron hulls and steam propulsion came first under our hands. It was not long
before our new command of the sea was noted. Somewhat grudgingly, the
conservative sea-mandarins were brought to a knowledge that their torpor was
fatal. The Navy stirred and lost little time in traversing the leeway. They progressed
on a path of experiment and probation suited to their needs, striving
to construct mightier vessels and to forge new and greater arms. Exploring
every avenue in their quest for aid and material, every byway for furtherance
of their aims, they drew strange road-fellows within their ranks, new workmen
to the sea. The engines of their adoption called for crafty hands to serve and
adjust them. Steam we knew in our time and could understand, but auxiliary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
mechanics outgrew the limits of our comprehension; naval practice became
a science outwith the bounds of our sea-lore, a new trade, whose only likeness
to ours lay in its service on the same wide sea.</p>

<p>Parted from the need to draw arms, secure in the knowledge of adequate
naval protection, the Merchants' Service developed their ships and tackle in the
ways of a free world trade. By shrewd engagement and industry in the counting-house,
diligence and forethought in the building-yards, keen sailing and efficiency
on the sea, the structure of our maritime supremacy was built up and maintained.
Monopolies and hindering trade reservations and restrictions barred the way,
but yielded to the spirit of our progress. Vested interests in seas and continents
had to be fought and conquered, and there was room and scope for lingering
combative instincts in the keen competition that arose for the world's carrying
trade. Other nations came on the free seas, secure in the peace our arms had
wrought, and entered the lists against us. The challenge to our seafaring we
met by skill and hardihood&mdash;keener and more polished arms than the weapons
of our sea-fathers. The coming of competitors spurred us to sea-deeds in the
handling of our ships and cargoes, dispatch in the ports, and activity in the
yards, that brought acknowledged victory to our flag. Every sense and thought
that was in us was used to further our supremacy. The craft and workmanship
of the builders and enterprise of the merchants provided us with the most
beautiful of man's creations on the sea&mdash;the square-rigged sailing ship of the
nineteenth century. With pride we sailed her. We, too, brought science to
our calling; rude, perhaps, and not readily defined save by a long, hard pupilage.
Not less than the calibre of the new naval ordnance was the measure of our
sail spread, not inferior to ironclad hulls the speed and beauty of our clippers&mdash;we
paralleled the roads of their strategy by the masterly handling of a cloud in
sail. With a regularity and precision as noted as our naval sea-brothers' advance
in gunfire, we served the trade and the mails, and spread the flood of emigration
to the rise and glory of the Empire.</p>

<p>With the decline of square sail, a new way of seafaring opened to us. In
the first of our steam pioneering, we took our yards and canvas with us, as good
part of our sea-kit; a safe provision, as we thought, against the inevitable
failure we looked for in the new navigation. We were conservatively jealous
of our gallant top hamper, and scorned the promise of a power that only dimly
as yet we understood. But&mdash;the promise held. In a few years we became
converts to the new order, in which we found a greater security, a more definite
reliance, than in the angles of our sail plane. There was no longer a need for our
precious 'stand by,' and we unrigged the wind tackle and accepted our new
shipmate, the marine engineer, as a worthy brother seaman. It was not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the spars and the cordage and the sails we put ashore. With all the gallant
litter we unloaded, condemned to the junk-heap, went a part of our seamanship
as closely woven to the canvas as the seams our hands had sewn.</p>

<p>In steam practice, new problems required to be studied and resolved;
challenges to our vaunted sea-lore came up that called for radical revision of
older methods and ideas. Changes, as wide and drastic as the evolutions of a
decade in sail, were presented in a swift succession of as many days. With eyes
now turned from aloft to ahead, we retyped our seamanship to meet the altered
conditions of the veer in our outlook. Unhelped, if unhindered, in our efforts,
we adapted our calling to the sudden and revolutionary innovations in construction
and power of the new ships. We grew sensible of gaps in our knowledge,
of voids in education that our earlier handicraft had not revealed. Severed,
by press of our sea-work, from the facilities for study that now offered advancement
to the landsman, we sought in alert and constant practice a substitute
for technical instruction. By step and stride and canter we jockeyed each new
starter from the shipyards, and studied their paces and behaviour on the vexed
testing courses of the open sea. If our methods were rude in trial, they settled
to efficiency in service. We paced in step with the rapid developments of the
shipwright's art, the not less active contrivance of the engineers. We kept no
man waiting for a sea-controller to his new and untried machine: there was no
whistling for a pilot on the grounds of our reaches. From oversea dredger and
frail harbour tug to the magnitude of an <i>Aquitania</i>, we were ever ready to board
her on the launching ways and steer her to the limits of her draught.</p>

<p>A Hakluyt of the day would have a full measure for his enthusiasm in the
shear of our keels on every sea, the flutter of our flags to all the winds. By
virtue of worthy vessels and good seamanship, the Red Ensign was devoted to
a world service; by good guardianship and commercial rectitude the Merchants'
Service held charge of the world's wealth in transport&mdash;the burden of the ships.
All nations put trust in us for sea-carriage. The Spanish onion-grower on the
slopes of Valencia, the Java sugar merchants, the breeders of Plata, looked to
their harbours for sight of our hulls to load their products. Greek boatmen took
payment for their cases on a scrap of dingy paper; the tide-labourers of the
world demanded no earnest of their fees ere setting to work&mdash;our flag was their
guarantor. The incoming of our ships brought throng to the quay-sides of far
seaports; the outgoing sent the prospering merchants to the bank counters,
to draw value from our skill in navigation, our integrity, and sea-care.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />THE STRUCTURE</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> avalanche of war found us, if unprepared, not unready. The Merchants'
Service was in the most efficient state of all its long story. Bounteous harvests
had set a tide of prosperity to all parts of the world. Trade had reached the
summit of a register in volume and account. The transport of the world's
goods was busied as never before. With every outward stern wash went a full
lading of our manufactures&mdash;a bulk of coal, a mass of wrought steel; foam at
the bows&mdash;returning, brought exchange in food and raw materials, grist to the
mills of our toiling artisans&mdash;a further provision for continuation of our trading.
There were no idle keels swinging the tides in harbour for want of profitable
employment; no seamen lounging on the dockside streets awaiting a 'sight'
to sign-on for a voyage. Bulk of cargoes exceeded the tonnage of the ships,
and the riverside shipyards resounded to the busy clamour of new construction.
Advanced systems of propulsion had emerged from tentative stages, were fully
tried and proved, and owners were adding to their fleets the latest and largest
vessels that art of shipwrights and skill of the engineers could supply. We
were well built and well found and well employed in all respects, not unready
for any part that called us to sea.</div>

<p>On such a stage the gage was thrown. Right on the heels of the courier
with challenge accepted, went the ships laden with a new and precious cargo&mdash;our
gallant men-at-arms. Before a shot of ours was fired, the first blow in the
conflict was swung by passage of the ships: throughout the length of it, only
by the sea-lanes could the shock be maintained.</p>

<p>Viewing the numbers and tonnage of the ships, the roll and character of the
seamen, we were not uneasy for the sea-front. With the most powerful war
fleet in the world boarding on the coasts of the enemy, we had little to fear.
The transports and war-service vessels could be adequately safeguarded: the
peaceful traders on their lawful occasions could trust in international law of the
civilized seas, on which no destruction may be effected without cause, prefaced
by examination. Of raiders and detached war units there might be some
apprehension, but the White Ensign was abroad and watchful&mdash;it was impossible
that the shafts of the enemy could reach us on the sea. For a time we set
out on our voyages and returned without interference.</p>

</div>

<p>Anon, an amazing circumstance shocked our blythe assurance. In a new
warfare, by traverse of a route we thought was barred, the impossible became
a stern reality! While able, by power of their ships and skill and gallantry of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the men, to keep the surface naval forces of the enemy doomed to ignoble
harbour watch, the mightiest war fleet the seas had ever carried was impotent
wholly to protect us! Our Achilles heel was exposed to merciless under-water
attack, to a new weapon, deadly in precision and difficult to counter or evade.
Throwing to the winds all shreds of honour and conscionable restraint, all
vestiges of a sea-respect for non-combatants and neutrals, the pacts and bounds
of international law&mdash;the humane sea-usages that spared women and children
and stricken wounded&mdash;the decivilized German set up the banners of a stark
piracy, an ocean anarchy, to whose lieutenants the sea-wolves of an earlier age
were but feeble enervated weaklings.</p>

<p>Piracy, gloried in and undisguised, faced us. Well and definite! We had
known piracy in the long years of our sea-history: we had dealt with their trade
to a full settlement at yard-arm or gallows. The course of our seafaring was
not to be arrested by even the deep roots and deadly poison of this not unknown
sea-growth: we had scaled the foul barnacles and cut the rank weeds before
in the course of sea-development. If our ways had become peaceful in the
long years of unchallenged trading, our habits were never less than combatant
throughout a life of struggle with storm and tide. Not while we had a ship
and a man to the helm would we be driven from the sea; our hard-won heritage
was not to be delivered under threat or operation of even the most surpassing
frightfulness. Jealousy for our seafaring, for our name as sailors, forbade
that we should skulk in harbour or linger behind the nets and booms. Our
work, our livelihood, our proud sea-trade, our honour was on the open sea.
Our pride was this&mdash;that, in our action, we would be followed by the seafarers
of the world. It was for no idle vaunt we boasted our supremacy at
sea. If we could take first place of the world's seamen in time of peace, our
station was to lead in war. We put out to sea&mdash;the neutrals followed. Had
we held to port, German orders would have halted the sea-traffic of the world.
With no shield but our seamanship, no weapon but the keenness of our eyes, no
power of defence or assault other than the swing of a ready helm, we met the
pirates on the sea, with little pretension in victory and no whining in defeat.</p>

<p>Challenged to stand and submit, the <i>Vosges</i> answered with a cant of the
helm and hoist of her flag, and stood on her way under a merciless hail of shot.
Unarmed, outsped, there was little prospect of escape&mdash;only, in an obstinate
sea-pride, lay acceptance of the challenge. With decks littered by wreckage
and wounded, bridge swept by shrapnel, water making through her torn hull,
there was no thought to lay-to and droop the flag in surrender. When, at
length, the ensign was shot away, there were men enough to hoist another. In
hours their agony was measured, until, in despair of completing his foul work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the enemy gave up the contest. Reeking of the combat, the <i>Vosges</i> foundered
under her wounds. The sea took her from her gallant crew, but they had not
given up the ship&mdash;their flag still fluttered at the peak as she went down. <i>Anglo-Californian</i>
fought a grim, silent fight for four hours, matching the intensity of
the German gunfire by the dogged quality of her mute defiance. <i>Palm Branch</i>
turned away from galling fire at short range, double-banked the press in the
stokehold, and cut and turned on her course to confuse the ranges. Her stern
was shattered by shell, the lifeboats blown away; the apprentice at the wheel
stood to his job with blood running in his eyes. Fire broke out and added a
new terror to the situation. There was no flinching. Through it all the engines
turned steadily, driven to their utmost speed by the engineers and firemen. A
one-sided affair&mdash;a floating hell for seamen to stand by, helpless, and take a
frightful gruelling! But they stood to it, and came to port.</p>

<p>If, under new and treacherous blows, our hearts beat the faster, there was
little pause, no stoppage, in the steady coursing of our sea-arteries. We fought
the menace with the same spirit our old sea-fathers knew. Undeterred by the
ghastly handicap against us&mdash;the galling fetters of a policy that kept us unarmed,
we pitted our brains and seamanship against the murderous mechanics of the
enemy. To the new under-water attack there were few adequate counter-measures
in the records of our old seafaring. We revised the standard manual, drew text
from old games, shield from the cuttlefish, models for our sweeps from discarded
sea-tackle. Special devices, new plans, stern services were called for; we
devised, we specialized&mdash;our readiness was never more instant. Out of our
strength we built up a new Service. Instruction and equipment came from the
Royal Navy, but the men were ours. In the throes of our exertions the
Merchants' Service repeated a tradition. The stout aged tree shot forth another
worthy limb&mdash;a second Navy&mdash;not less ardent or resourceful than the first
offshoot, now grown to be our guardian.</p>

<p>Our branches twined and interlocked in service of a joint endeavour. Under
the fierce blast of war we swayed and weighed together in shield of our ancient
foundation. Within our ranks we had cunning fishers, keen, resolute sea-fighters
of the banks, to whom the coming of a strange mechanical devil-fish
offered a new zest to the chase, a famous netting. Enrolled to Special Service,
they engaged the enemy at his doorstep and patrolled the areas of his outset.
Undaunted by the odds, deterred by no risk or threat, they ranged and searched
the sea-channels and cleared the lanes for our safe passage. To detect, to warn,
to meet and counter-charge the submarine in his depths, to safeguard the
narrow seas from hazard of the mines, was all in the day's work of the
<i>Temporary</i> R.N.R.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout all the enrolments, the divisions, the changes, and the training
for new and special duties, there was no easing of the engines: we effected our
adjustments and allotments under a full head of steam. All that the enemy
could do could not prevent the steady reinforcement of our arms, the passage
of our men, the transport of our trade. The long lines of our sea-communications
remained unbroken, despite our losses and the grim spectre of the raft and the
open boat. It could not be otherwise&mdash;and Britain stand. There could be no
halt in the sea-traffic. Only from abroad could we draw supplies to raise the
new leaguer of our island garrison; only by way of the sea could we retain and
renew our strength.</p>

<p>In time the intolerable shackles of inactive resistance were struck from our
hands. Somewhat tardily we were supplied with weapons of defence and
instructed in their use and maintainance. We went to school again, under
tutelage of the Naval Service, and drew a helpful assistance from the tale of
their courses since we had parted company. We were heartened by the new
spirit of co-operation with the fighting service. Ungrudgingly they lent experts
to direct our movement. They turned a stream of their inventive talent in the
ways of gear and apparatus to protect our ships. They shipped our ordnance,
and supplied skilled gunners to leaven our rude crews. More, they helped to
strip the veneer of convention that hampered us&mdash;our devotion to standard
practice in rules and lights and equipment. We learned our lessons. Even
though the peaceful years had lessened our fighting spring, we had lost no aptitude
for service of the guns in defence of our rights, nor for measure to deceive
or evade. Armed and alert, we returned to the sea, confident in the discard of
a weight in our handicap. We could strike back, and with no feeble blow&mdash;as
the pirates soon learned.</p>

<p>There were scores to settle. <i>Palm Branch</i>, belying her tranquil name, took
a payment in full for her shattered stern and the blood running in the steersman's
eyes. Keen eyes sighted a periscope in time. The helm was put over
and the white track raced across the stern, missing by feet. Baffled in under-water
attack, the enemy hove up from his depths to open surface fire. He
never had opportunity. If look-out was good, gun action was as quick and
ready in <i>Palm Branch</i>. Her first shot struck the conning-tower, the second
drove home on the submarine, which sank. While all eyes were focused on
the settling wash and spreading scum of oil, a new challenge came and was as
speedily accepted. A shell, fired by a second submarine at long range, passed
over the steamer. Slewing round to a new target, the gunners kept up a steady
return, shot for shot. The submarine dropped farther astern, fearing the probe
of a bracket: he angled his course to bring both his guns in action. Two pieces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
against the steamer's one! At that, he fared no better. Firing continuously,
eighty rounds in less than an hour, he registered not one hit.</p>

<p>At length <i>Palm Branch's</i> steady, methodical search for the range had effect.
Her gunners capped the day's fine shooting by a direct hit on the submarine's
after-gun, shattering the piece. At evens again&mdash;the U-boat ceased fire and
drew off, possibly under threat of British patrols approaching at full speed, more
probably for the good and sufficient reason that he had had enough.</p>

<p>Not all our contests were as happily decided. If&mdash;shirking the issue of the
guns, with no zest for a square fight&mdash;the German went to his depths, he had
still the deadly torpedo to enforce a toll. The toll we paid and are paying,
but there is no stoppage in the round by which the nation is fed and her arms
served. The burden is heavy and our losses great, but we have not failed.
We dare not fail.</p>

<h3>OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NAVY</h3>


<h3><br />JOINING FORCES</h3>

<div class='cap'>AFTER an interval of a hundred years, we are come to work together
again, banded, as in the days of the Armada, to keep the seas against
a ruthless challenger. In view of a new blood-bond between us, it is
difficult to write coldly of the causes that have kept us apart. Only by preface
of an affirmation can it be made possible. Through all our differences, prejudices,
envies&mdash;perhaps jealousies&mdash;there ran at least one clear unsullied thread&mdash;our
admiration for the Navy, our glory in its strength and power, our belief in its
matchless efficiency.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>We seamen, naval or mercantile, are a stout unmovable breed. Tenacity
to our convictions is deeply rooted. The narrow trends of shipboard life give
licence to a conservatism that out-Herods Herod in intensity, unreason&mdash;in
utter sophistry. We extend this atmosphere to our relationships, to the associations
with the beach, with other sea-services, with other ships&mdash;to the absurd
pretensions of the other watch. "A sailorman afore a landsman, an' a shipmate
afore all," may be a useful creed, but it engenders a contentious outlook,
an intolerance difficult to reconcile. In the fo'c'sle, the upholding of a 'last
ship' may lead to a broken nose; aft, the officers may quarrel, wordily, over
the grades of their service; ashore, the captain may only reserve his confidences
for a peer of his tonnage; over all, the distance between the Naval and Merchants'
Services was immeasurable and complete.</p>

<p>If it was so to this date, it was perhaps more intense in the old days when
common seafaring had not set as broad a distinction, as widely divergent a
sea-practice, as our modern services shew. That such a contentious atmosphere
existed we have ample witness. After experience as a merchants' man, Nelson
wrote of his re-entry. "I returned a practical seaman with a horror of the
Royal Navy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was many weeks before I got the least reconciled to a
man-o'-war, so deep was the prejudice rooted!" We have no such noted
record of a merchant seaman re-entering from the Navy. Doubtless the laxity
and indiscipline he might observe would produce a not dissimilar revulsion.</p>

<p>In the years that have elapsed since Nelson wrote, we have had few opportunities
to compose our differences, to get on better terms with one another.
The course of naval development took the great war fleets hull down on our
commercial horizon, beyond casual intercommunication. On rare and widely
separated occasions we fell into an expedition together, but the unchallenged
power of the naval forces only served to heighten the barriers that stood between
us. At the Crimea, in India, on the Chinese and Egyptian expeditions, during
the Boer War, we were important links in the venture, but no more important
than the cargoes we ferried. There was no call for any service other than
our usual sea-work. The Navy saw to it that our comings and goings were
unmolested. We were sea-civilians, purely and simply; there was nothing
more to be said about it.</p>

<p>If little was said, it was with no good grace we took such a station. There
were those who saw that seafaring could not thus arbitrarily be divided. Other
nations were stirring and striving to a naval strength and power, drawing aid
and personnel from their mercantile services. Sea-strength and paramountcy
might not wholly come to be measured in terms of thickness of the armour-plating&mdash;in
calibre of the great guns. Auxiliary services would be required.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
The Navy could no more work without us than the Army without a Service
Corps.</p>

<p>The Royal Naval Reserve came as a link to our intercourse. Certain of
our shipmates left us for a period of naval training. They came back changed
in many particulars. They had acquired a social polish, were perhaps less
'sailor-like' in their habits. As a rule they were discontented with the way
of things in their old ships; the quiet rounds bored them after the crowded
life in a warship. We were frequently reminded of how well and differently
things were done in <i>the</i> Service. Perhaps, in return, we took the wrong line.
We made no effort to sift their experiences, to find out how we might improve
our ways. Often our comrade's own particular shrewdness was cited as a reason
for the better ways of naval practice. We were rather irritated by the note
of superiority assumed, perhaps somewhat jealous. Had commissions been
granted on a competitive basis, we might have accepted such a tone, but we
had our own way of assessing sea-values, and saw no reason why we should
stand for these new airs. What was in it, what had wrought the change, we
were never at pains to investigate. It was enough for us to note that, though
his watch-keeping was certainly improved, our re-entered shipmate did not
seem to be as efficient as a navigator or cargo supervisor as once we had thought
him. All his talk of drills and guns and station-keeping considered, he seemed
to have quite forgotten that groundnuts are thirteen hundredweights to the
space ton and ought not to be stowed near fine goods!</p>

<p>On the other hand, he might reasonably be expected to see his old shipmates
in a new light. Rude, perhaps. Of limited ideas. Tied to the old
round of petty bickerings and small intrigues. He would note the want of trusty
brotherhood. His sojourn among better-educated men may have roused his
ideas to an appreciation of values that deep-sea life had obscured. The lack
of the discipline to which he had become accustomed would appal and disquiet
him. In time he would be worn to the rut again, but who can say the same
rut? Unconsciously, we were influenced by his quieter manners. In self-study
we saw faults that had been unnoticed before his return. Reviewing our hard
sea-life, we recalled our exclusion from benefits of instruction that went a-begging
on the beach. We stirred. There might yet be time to make up the leeway.</p>

<p>The influence of naval training was never very pronounced among the seamen
and firemen of the Merchants' Service who were attached to the R.N.R. Their
periods of training were too short for them to be permanently influenced by the
discipline of the Navy (or our indiscipline on their return to us may have blighted
a promising growth!) On short-term training they were rarely allotted to
important work. The governing attitude was rather that they should be used as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
auxiliaries, mercantile handymen, in a ship. If there was a stowage of stores,
cleaning up of bilges, chipping and scaling of iron rust&mdash;well, here was mercantile
Jack, who was used to that kind of work; who better for the job? Generally,
he returned to his old ways rather tired of Navy 'fashion' and discipline, and
one saw but little influence of his temporary service on a cruiser. Usually, he
was a good hand, to begin with: he sought a post on good ships: with his
papers in order we were very glad to have him back.</p>

<p>In few other ways did we come in touch with the Navy. At times the misfortune
of the sea brought us into a naval port for assistance in our distress.
Certainly, assistance was readily forthcoming, a full measure, but in a somewhat
cold and formal way that left a rankling impression that we were not&mdash;well, we
were not perhaps desirable acquaintances. The naval manner was not unlike
that of a courteous prescribing chemist over his counter. "Have you had the
pain&mdash;long?" "Is there any&mdash;coughing?" We had always the feeling that
they were bored by our custom, were anxious to get back to the mixing of new
pills, to their experiments. We were not very sorry when our repairs were
completed and we could sail for warmer climates.</p>

<p>With the outbreak of war the R.N.R. was instantly mobilized. Their outgoing
left a sensible gap in our ranks, a more considerable rift than we had
looked for. Example drew others on their trodden path, our mercantile seamen
were keen for fighting service; the unheralded torpedo had not yet struck home
on their own ships. Commissions to a new entry of officers were still limited and
capricious&mdash;the <i>Hochsee Flotte</i> had not definitely retired behind the booms at
Kiel and Wilhelmshaven, to weave a web of murder and assassination. For a
short term we sailed on our voyages, on a steady round, differing but little from
our normal peace-time trade.</p>

<p>A short term. The enemy did not leave us long secure in our faith in civilized
sea-usage. Our trust in International Law received a rude and shattering shock
from deadly floating mine and racing torpedo. Paralysed and impotent to
venture a fleet action, the German Navy was to be matched not only against
the commercial fleets of Britain and her Allies, but against every merchant
ship, belligerent or neutral. There was to be no gigantic clash of sea-arms;
action was to be taken on the lines of Thuggery. The German chose his opponents
as he chose his weapons. Assassins' weapons! The knife in the dark&mdash;no
warning, no quarter, sink or swim! The 'sea-civilians' were to be driven
from the sea by exercise of the most appalling frightfulness and savagery that
the seas had ever known.</p>

<p>Under such a threat our sea-services were brought together on a rapid sheer,
a close boarding, in which there was a measure of confusion. It could not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
been otherwise. The only provision for co-operation, the R.N.R. organization,
was directed to augment the forces of the Navy: there was no anticipation
of a circumstance that would sound a recall. Our machinery was built and
constructed to revolve in one direction; it could not instantly be reversed.
Into an ordered service, ruled by the most minute shades of seniority, the finest
influences of precedence and tradition, there came a need to fit the mixed alloy
of the Merchants' Service. Ready, eager, and willing, as both Services were,
to devote their energies to a joint endeavour, it took time and no small patience
to resolve the maze and puzzle of the jig-saw. Naval officers detailed for our
liaison were of varied moulds. Not many of the Active List could be spared;
our new administrators were mostly recalled from fishing and farming to take
up special duties for which they had few qualifications other than the gold lace
on their sleeves. Some were tactful and clever in appreciation of other values
than a mere readiness to salute, and those drew our affection and a ready
measure of confidence. Others set up plumed Gessler bonnets, to which we
were in no mood to bow. Only our devotion to the emergency exacted a jerk of
our heads. To them we were doubtless difficult and trying. Our free ways did
not fit into their schemes of proper routine. Accustomed to the lines of their
own formal service, to issuing orders only to their juniors, they had no guide
to a commercial practice whereby there can be a concerted service without the
usages of the guard-room. They made things difficult for us without easing
their own arduous task. They objected to our manners, our appearance, to
the clothes we wore. Our diffidence was deemed truculence: our reluctance
to accept a high doctrine of subservience was measured as insubordination.</p>

<p>The flames of war made short work of our moods and jealousies, prejudices,
and dislikes. A new Service grew up, the <i>Temporary</i> R.N.R., in which we were
admitted to a share in our own governance and no small part in combatant operations
at sea. The sea-going section found outlet for their energy and free scope
for a traditional privateering in their individual ventures against the enemy.
Patrolling and hunting gave high promise for their capacity to work on lines of
individual control. Minesweeping offered a fair field for the peculiar gifts of
seamanship that mercantile practice engenders. Commissioned to lone and
perilous service, they kept the seas in fair weather or foul. Although stationed
largely in the narrow seas, there were set no limits to the latitude and longitude
of their employment. The ice of the Arctic knew them&mdash;riding out the bitter
northern gales in their small seaworthy drifters, thrashing and pitching in the
seaway, to hold a post in the chain of our sea-communications. In the Adriatic
warmer tides lapped on their scarred hulls, but brought no relaxing variance
to their keen look-out. For want of a match of their own size, they had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
undying temerity to call three cheers and engage cruiser ordnance with their
pipe-stems! A service indeed! If but <i>temporary</i> in title, there is permanence
in their record!</p>

<p>Coincident with our actions on the sea&mdash;not alone those of our fighting cubs,
but also those of our trading seamen&mdash;a better feeling came to cement our
alliance. First in generous enthusiasm for our struggle against heavy odds, as
they came to understand our difficulties, naval officers themselves set about
to create a happier atmosphere. We were admitted to a voice in the league of
our defence. Administration was adjusted to meet many of our grievances.
Our capacity for controlling much of the machinery of our new movements was
no longer denied. The shreds of old conservatism, the patches of contention
and envy were scattered by a strong free breeze of reasoned service and joint
effort.</p>

<p>We meet the naval man on every turn of the shore-end of our seafaring.
We have grown to admire him, to like him, to look forward to his coming and
association in almost the same way that we are pleased at the boarding of our
favoured pilots. He fits into our new scheme of things as readily as the Port
Authorities and the Ship's Husband. The plumed bonnets are no longer set up
to attract our awed regard: by a better way than caprice and petulant discourtesy,
the naval officer has won a high place in our esteem. We have borrowed
from his stock to improve our store; better methods to control our manning,
a more dispassionate bearing, a ready subordinance to ensure service. His talk,
too. We use his phrases. We 'carry on'; we ask the 'drill' for this or that;
we speak of our sailing orders as 'pictures,' our port-holes are become 'scuttles.'
The enemy is a 'Fritz,' a depth-charge a 'pill,' torpedoes are 'mouldies.' In
speaking of our ships we now omit the definite article. We are getting on
famously together.</p>


<h3><br />AT SEA</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Although</span> our experience of their assured protection is clear and definite,
our personal acquaintance with the larger vessels of the Navy is not intimate.
Saving the colliers and the oilers and storeships that serve the Fleet, few of us
have seen a 'first-rate' on open sea since the day the Grand Fleet steered north
to battle stations. The strength and influence of the distant ships was plain
to us in the first days of the war even if we had actually no sight of their
grey hulls. While we were able to proceed on our lawful occasions with not
even a warning of possible interference, the mercantile ships of the enemy&mdash;being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
abroad&mdash;had no course but to seek the protection of a neutral port, not again
to put out to sea under their own colours.</div>

<p>The operation of a threat to shipping&mdash;at three thousand miles distance&mdash;was
dramatic in intensity under the light of acute contrast. Entering New York
a few days after war had been declared, we berthed alongside a crack German
liner. Her voyage had been abandoned: she lay at the pier awaiting events.
At the first, we stared at one another curiously. Her silent winches and closed
hatchways, deserted decks and passages, were markedly in contrast to the stir
and animation with which we set about unloading and preparing for the return
voyage. The few sullen seamen about her forecastle leant over the bulwarks
and noted the familiar routine that was no longer theirs. Officers on the bridge-deck
eyed our movements with interest, despite their apparent unconcern. We
were respectfully hostile: submarine atrocities had not yet begun. The same
newsboy served special editions to both ships. The German officers grouped
together, reading of the fall of Li&eacute;ge. Doubtless they confided to one another that
they would soon be at sea again. Five days we lay. At eight o'clock 'flags,' our
bugle-call accompanied the raising of the ensign: the red, white, and black
was hoisted defiantly at the same time. We unloaded, re-loaded, and embarked
passengers, and backed out into the North River on our way to sea again. The
<i>F&uuml;rst</i> ranged to the wash of our sternway as we cleared the piers; her hawsers
strained and creaked, then held her to the bollards of the quay.</p>

<p>Time and again we returned on our regular schedule, to find the German
berthed across the dock, lying as we had left her, with derricks down and her
hatchways closed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We noted the signs of neglect growing on her; guessed
at the indiscipline aboard that inaction would produce. For a while her men
were set to chipping and painting in the way of a good sea-custom, but the days
passed with no release and they relaxed handwork. Her topsides grew rusty,
her once trim and clean paintwork took on a grimy tint. Our doings were plain
to her officers and crew: we were so near that they could read the tallies on the
mailbags we handled: there were no mails from Germany. Loading operations,
that included the embarkation of war material, went on by night and day:
we were busied as never before. The narrow water space between her hull and
ours was crowded by barges taking and delivering our cargo; the shriek of
steam-tugs and clangour of their engine-bells advertised our stir and activity.
On occasion, the regulations of the port obliged the <i>F&uuml;rst</i> to haul astern, to
allow working space for the Merritt-Chapman crane to swing a huge piece of
ordnance to our decks. There were rumours of a concealed activity on the
German. "She was coaling silently at night, in preparation for a dash to sea."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "German
spies had their headquarters in her." The evening papers had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
new story of her secret doings whenever copy ran short. All the while she lay
quietly at the pier; we rated her by her draught marks that varied only with
the galley coal she burnt.</p>

<p>At regular periods her hopeless outlook was emphasized by our sailings.
Officers and crew could not ignore the stir that attended our departure. They
saw the 'blue peter' come fluttering from the masthead, and heard our syren
roar a warning to the river craft as we backed out. We were laden to our marks
and the decks were thronged with young Britons returning to serve their country.
The Fatherland could have no such help: the <i>F&uuml;rst</i> could handle no such cargo.
For her there could be no movement, no canting on the tide and heading under
steam for the open sea: the distant ships of the Grand Fleet held her in fetters
at the pier.</p>

<p>While the Battle Fleet opened the oceans to us, we were not wholly safe from
enemy interference on the high seas in the early stages of the war. German commerce
raiders were abroad; there was need for a more tangible protection to the
merchants' ships on the oversea trade routes. The older cruisers were sent out on
distant patrols. They were our first associates of the huge fleet subsequently
detailed for our defence and assistance. We were somewhat in awe of the naval
men at sea on our early introduction. The White Ensign was unfamiliar. Armed
to the teeth, an officer from the cruiser would board us: the bluejackets of his
boat's crew had each a rifle at hand. "Where were we from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our
cargo .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our passengers?" The lieutenant was sternly courteous; he was
engaged on important duties: there was no mood of relaxation. He returned
to his boat and shoved off with not one reassuring grin for the passengers lining
the rails interested in every row-stroke of his whaler. In time we both grew
more cordial: we improved upon acquaintance. The drudgery and monotony
of a lone patrol off a neutral coast soon brought about a less punctilious boarding.
Our <i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i> had unofficial intervals. "How were things at home?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Are
we getting the men trained quickly?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What about the Russians?" The
boarding lieutenants discovered the key to our affections&mdash;the secret sign that
overloaded their sea-boat with newspapers and fresh mess. "A fine ship you've
got here, Captain!" We parted company at ease and with goodwill. The boat
would cast off to the cheers of our passengers. The great cruiser, cleared for
action with her guns trained outboard, would cant in to close her whaler. Often
her band assembled on the upper deck: the favourite selections were 'Auld
Lang Syne' and 'Will ye no' come back again'&mdash;as she swung off on her
weary patrol.</p>

<p>Submarine activities put an end to these meetings on the sea. Except while
under ocean escort of a cruiser&mdash;when our relations by flag signal are studied and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
impersonal&mdash;we have now little acquaintance with vessels of that class. Counter-measures
of the new warfare demand the service of smaller vessels. Destroyers
and sloops are now our protectors and co-workers. With them, we are drawn to a
familiar intimacy; we are, perhaps, more at ease in their company, dreading no
formal routine. Admirals are, to us, awesome beings who seclude themselves
behind gold-corded secretaries: commodores (except those who control our
convoys) are rarely sea-going, and we come to regard them as schoolmasters,
tutors who may not be argued with; post-captains in command of the larger
escorts have the brusque assumption of a super-seamanship that takes no
note of a limit in manning. The commanders and lieutenants of the destroyers
and sloops that work with us are different; they are more to our mind&mdash;we
look upon them as brother seamen. Like ourselves, they are 'single-ship'
men. They are neither concerned with serious plans of naval strategy nor
overbalanced by the forms and usages of great ship routine. While 'the
bridge' of a cruiser may be mildly scornful upon receipt of an objection to her
signalled noon position, the destroyer captain is less assured: he is more likely
to request our estimate of the course and speed. His seamanship is comparable
to our own. The relatively small crew he musters has taught him to be tolerant
of an apparent delay in carrying out certain operations. In harbour he is frequently
berthed among the merchantmen, and has opportunity to visit the ships
and acquire more than a casual knowledge of our gear and appliances. He is
ever a welcome visitor, frank and manly and candid. Even if there is a dispute
as to why we turned north instead of south-east 'when that Fritz came up,' and
we blanked the destroyer's range, there is not the air of superior reproof that
rankles.</p>

<p>In all our relations with the Navy at sea there was ever little, if any, friction.
We saw no empty plumed bonnet in the White Ensign. We were proud of the
companionship and protection of the King's ships. Our ready service was never
grudged or stinted to the men behind the grey guns; succour in our distress
was their return. Incidents of our co-operation varied, but an unchanging sea-brotherhood
was the constant light that shone out in small occurrences and
deathly events.</p>

<p>Dawn in the Channel, a high south gale and a bitter confused sea. Even
with us, in a powerful deep-sea transport, the measure of the weather was
menacing; green seas shattered on board and wrecked our fittings, half of the
weather boats were gone, others were stove and useless. A bitter gale! Under
our lee the destroyer of our escort staggered through the hurtling masses that
burst and curled and swept her fore and aft. Her mast and one funnel were
gone, the bridge wrecked; a few dangling planks at her davits were all that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
left of her service boats. She lurched and faltered pitifully, as though she had
loose water below, making through the baulks and canvas that formed a makeshift
shield over her smashed skylights. In the grey of the murky dawn there
was yet darkness to flash a message: "<i>In view of weather probably worse as
wind has backed, suggest you run for Waterford while chance, leaving us to carry on
at full speed.</i>" An answer was ready and immediate: "<i>Reply. Thanks. I
am instructed escort you to port.</i>"</p>

<p>The Mediterranean. A bright sea and sky disfigured by a ring of curling
black smoke&mdash;a death-screen for the last agonies of a torpedoed troopship.
Amid her littering entrails she settles swiftly, the stern high upreared, the bows
deepening in a wash of wreckage. Boats, charged to inches of freeboard, lie off,
the rowers and their freight still and open-mouthed awaiting her final plunge.
On rafts and spars, the upturned strakes of a lifeboat, remnants of her manning
and company grip safeguard, but turn eyes on the wreck of their parent hull.
Into the ring, recking nothing of entangling gear or risk of suction, taking the
chances of a standing shot from the lurking submarine, a destroyer thunders
up alongside, brings up, and backs at speed on the sinking transport. Already
her decks are jammed to a limit, by press of a khaki-clad cargo she was never
built to carry. This is final, the last turn of her engagement. The foundering
vessel slips quickly and deeper. "Come along, Skipper! You've got 'em all
off! You can do no more! <i>Jump!</i>"</p>


<h3><br />OUR WAR STAFF</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Some</span> years before the war we were lying at an East Indian port, employed
in our regular trade. The military students of the Quetta Staff College were
in the district, engaged in practical exercise of their staff lessons. On a Sunday
(our loading being suspended) they boarded us to work out in detail a question
of troop transport. It was assumed that our ship was requisitioned in an
emergency, and their problem was to estimate the number of men we could
carry and to plan arrangement of the troop decks. Their inspection was to be
minute; down to the sufficiency of our pots and pans they were required to
investigate and figure out the resources of our vessel. The officer students were
thirty-four in number; at least we counted thirty-four who came to us for clue
to the mysteries of gross and register and dead-weight tonnage. In parties
they explored our holds and accommodation, measured in paces for a rough
survey, and prepared their plans. Their Commandant (a very famous soldier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to-day) permitted us to be present when the officers were assembled and their
papers read out and discussed. In general it was estimated that the work of
alteration and fitting the ship for troops would occupy from eight to ten working
days. Our quota&mdash;of all ranks&mdash;averaged about eleven hundred men.</div>

<span class="caption">A BRITISH SUBMARINE DETAILED FOR INSTRUCTION OF MERCHANT OFFICERS</span>
</div>

<p>The work was sound and no small ingenuity was advanced in planning
adaptations, but the spirit of emergency did not show an evidence in their
careful papers. The proposed voyage was distinctly stated to be from Newhaven
to Dieppe, and it seemed to us that the elaborate accommodation for a
prison, a guard-room, a hospital, were somewhat ambitious for a six-hour sea-passage.
In conversation with the Commandant, we were of opinion that, to
a degree, their work and pains were rather needless. Carrying passengers
(troops and others) was our business; a trade in which we had been occupied
for some few years. He agreed. He regarded their particular exercise in the
same light as the 'herring-and-a-half' problem of the schoolroom: it was
good for the young braves to learn something of their only gangway to a foreign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
field. "Of course," he said, "if war comes it will be duty for the Navy to supervise
our sea-transport." We understood that their duty would be to safeguard
our passage, but we had not thought of supervision in outfit. The Commandant
was incredulous when we remarked that we had never met a naval transport
officer, that we knew of no plans to meet such an emergency as that submitted
to his officers. It was evident that his trained soldierly intendance could not
contemplate a situation in which the seamen of the country had no foreknowledge
of a war service; it was amazing to him that we were not already drilled for
duties that might, at any moment, be thrust upon us. Pointing across the dock
to where two vessels of the Bremen Hansa Line were working in haste to catch
the tide, he affirmed that they would be better prepared: <i>their</i> place in mobilization
would be detailed, their duties and services made clear.</p>

<p>We knew of no plans for our employment in war service; we had no position
allotted to us in measures for emergency. We were sufficiently proud of our
seafaring to understand a certain merit in this apparent lack of prevision:
we took it as in compliment to the efficiency and resource with which our sea-trade
was credited. Was it not on our records that the Isle of Man steamers
transported 58,000 people in the daylight hours of an August Bank Holiday.
A seventy-mile passage. Trippers. Less amenable to ordered direction than
disciplined troops. A day's work, indeed. Unequalled, unbeaten by any record
to date in the amazing statistics of the war. There was no need for supervision
and direction: we knew our business, we could pick up the tune as we marched.</p>

<p>We did. On the outbreak of war we fell into our places in transport of troops
and military material with little more ado than in handling our peace-time
cargoes. The ship on which the Staff students worked their problems set out
on almost the very route they had planned for her, but with no prison or guard-room
or hospital, and sixteen hundred troops instead of eleven: the time taken
to fit her (including discharge of a cargo) occupied exactly four days. We saw
but little of the naval authority.</p>

<span class="caption">THE D.A.M.S. GUNWHARF AT GLASGOW</span>
</div>

<p>Later, in our war work, we made the acquaintance of the naval transport
officer. Generally, he was not intimate with the working of merchant ships.
His duties were largely those of interpretation. Through him Admiralty passed
their orders: it devolved on the mercantile shore staff of the shipping companies
to carry these orders into execution. If, in transport services, our marine
superintendents and ships' husbands did not share in the honours, it was not
for want of merit. They could not complain of lack of work in the early days
of the war when the transport officer was serving his apprenticeship to the
trade. The absence of a keen knowledge and interest in commercial ship-practice
at the transport office made for complex situations; hesitancies and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
conflicting orders added to the arduous business. Under feverish pressure
a ship would be unloaded on to quay space already congested, ballast be contracted
for&mdash;and delivered; a swarm of carpenters, working day and night,
would fit her for carriage of troops. At the eleventh hour some one idly fingering
a tide-table would discover that the vessel drew too much water to cross the
bar of her intended port of discharge. (The marine superintendent was frequently
kept in ignorance of the vessel's intended destination.) Telegraph and telephone
are handy&mdash;"Requisition cancelled" is easily passed over the wires! <i>As you
were</i> is a simple order in official control, but it creates an atmosphere of misdirection
almost as deadly as German gas. Only our tremendous resources, the
sound ability of our mercantile superintendents, the industry of the contractors
and quay staffs, brought order out of chaos and placed the vessels in condition
for service at disposal of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Despite all blunders and vacillations our expedition was not unworthy of
the emergency. How much better we could have done had there been a considered
scheme of competent control must ever remain a conjecture. Four
years of war practice have improved on the hasty measures with which we met
the first immediate call. Sea-transport of troops and munitions of war has
become a highly specialized business for naval directorate and mercantile executant
alike. Ripe experience in the thundering years has sweetened our relations.
The naval transport officer has learnt his trade. He is better served. He has
now an adequate executant staff, recruited largely from the Merchants' Service.
With liberal assistance he relies less on telegraph and telephone to advance his
work: our atmosphere is no longer polluted by the miasma of indecision,
and by the chill airs of the barracks.</p>

<p>Of our Naval War Staff, the transport officer was the first on the field, but
his duties were only concerned with ships requisitioned for semi-naval service.
For long we had no national assistance in our purely commercial seafaring.
Our sea-rulers (if they existed) were unconcerned with the judicious employment
of mercantile tonnage: some of our finest liners were swinging the tides in
harbour, rusting at their cables&mdash;serving as prison hulks for interned enemies.
Our service on the sea was as lightly held. We made our voyages as in peace-time.
We had no means of communication with the naval ships at sea other
than the universally understood International Code of Signals. Any measures
we took to keep out of the way of enemy war vessels, then abroad, were
our own. We had no Intelligence Service to advise us in our choice of sea-routes,
and act as distributors of confidential information. We were far too
'jack-easy' in our seafaring: we estimated the enemy's sea-power over-lightly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>In time we learned our lesson. Tentative measures were advanced. Admiralty,
through the Trade Division, took an interest in our employment. Orders
and advices took long to reach us. These were first communicated to the War
Risks Associations, who sent them to our owners. We received them as part
of our sailing orders, rather late to allow of considered efforts on our part to
conform with their tenor. There was no channel of direct communication.
When on point of sailing, we projected our own routes, recorded them in a sealed
memorandum which we left with our owners. If we fell overdue Admiralty
could only learn of our route by application to the holders of the memorandum.
A short trial proved the need for a better system. Shipping Intelligence Officers
were appointed at the principal seaports. At this date some small echo of our
demand for a part in our governance had reached the Admiralty. In selecting
officers for these posts an effort was made to give us men with some understanding
of mercantile practice; a number of those appointed to our new staff were
senior officers of the R.N.R. who were conversant with our way of business.
(If they did, on occasion, project a route for us clean through the Atlantic ice-field
in May, they were open to accept a criticism and reconsider the voyage.)
With them were officers of the Royal Navy who had specialized in navigation,
a branch of our trade that does not differ greatly from naval practice. They
joined with us in discussion of the common link that held few opportunities for
strained association. Certainly we took kindly to our new directors from the
first; we worked in an atmosphere of confidence. The earliest officer appointed
to the West Coast would blush to know the high esteem in which he is held, a
regard that (perhaps by virtue of his tact and courtesy) was in course extended
to his colleagues of a later date.</p>

<p>The work of the S.I.O. is varied and extensive. His principal duty is to
plan and set out our oversea route, having regard to his accurate information
of enemy activities. All Admiralty instructions as to our sea-conduct pass
through his hands. He issues our confidential papers and is, in general, the
channel of our communication with the Naval Service. He may be likened to
our signal and interlocking expert. On receipt of certain advices he orders the
arm of the semaphore to be thrown up against us. The port is closed to the
outward-bound. His offices are quickly crowded by masters seeking information
for their sailings: with post and telephone barred to us in this connection, we
must make an appearance in person to receive our orders. A tide or two may
come and go while we wait for passage. We have opportunity, in the waiting-room,
to meet and become intimate with our fellow-seafarers. It is good for
the captain of a liner to learn how the captain of a North Wales schooner makes
his bread, the difficulties of getting decent yeast at the salt-ports; how the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
schooner's boy won't learn ("indeed to goodness") the proper way his captain
shows him to mix the dough!</p>

<p>On telegraphic advice the arm of the semaphore rattles down. The port is
open to traffic again. The waiting-room is emptied and we are off to the sea,
perhaps fortified by the S.I.O.'s confidence that the cause of the stoppage has
been violently removed from the sea-lines.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of ruthless submarine warfare we were armed for defence.
Gunnery experts were added to our war complement. A division for organization
of our ordnance was formed, the Defensively Armed Merchant Ships Department
of the Admiralty. We do not care for long titles; we know this division
as the "Dam Ships." Most of the officers appointed to this Service are R.N.R.
They are perhaps the most familiar of the war staff detailed to assist us. Their
duties bring them frequently on board our ships, where (on our own ground)
relations grow quickly most intimate and cordial. The many and varied patterns
of guns supplied for our defence made a considerable shore establishment necessary,
not alone for the guns and mountings, but for ammunition of as many
marks as a Geelong wool-bale. In the first stages of our war-harnessing, the
supply of guns was limited to what could be spared from battlefield and naval
armament. The range of patterns varied from pipe-stems to what was at one
time major armament for cruisers; we had odd weapons&mdash;<i>soixante-quinze</i> and
Japanese pieces; even captured German field-guns were adapted to our needs
in the efforts of the D.A.M.S. to arm us. Standardization in mounting and
equipment was for long impossible. Our outcry for guns was cleverly met
by the department. We could not wait for weapons to be forged: by working
'double tides' they ensured a twenty-four-hour day of service for the guns
in issue, by a system that our ordnance should not remain idle during our stay
in port. Incoming ships were boarded in the river, their guns and ammunition
dismounted and removed to serve the needs of a vessel bound out on the same
tide. The problem of fitting a 12-pounder on a 4.7 emplacement taxed the
department's ingenuity and resource, but few ships were held in port for failure
of their prompt action.</p>

<p>With the near approach to standardization in equipment (a state that came
with increased production of merchant-ship arms) the division was able to
reorganize on more settled lines. New types of armament were issued to them
and there was less adaptation for emplacements to be considered. With every
ship fitted, the pressure on their resource was eased, the new ships being constructed
to carry guns as a regular part of their equipment. While their activities
are now less confused by the new methods, there is no reduction in their employment.
Other defensive apparatus has been placed in their hands for issue and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
control, and their principal port establishments have grown from small temporary
offices to large well-manned depots. To the surface guns have been added
howitzers, bomb-throwers, and depth-charges for under-water action: smoke-screen
fittings and chemicals form a part of their stock in trade: they issue
mine-sinking rifles, and even control the supply of our zigzag clocks. The range
of their work is constantly being extended. Their duties include inspection to
ensure that darkening ship regulations may not fail for want of preparation in
port. Makeshift screening at sea is dangerous.</p>

<p>Their establishments are at the principal seaports, with branch connections
and transport facilities for reaching the smaller harbours. The gun-wharves
may not present as splendid a spectacle as the huge store-sheds of our naval
bases, but they have at least the busy air of being well occupied, a brisk appearance
of having few 'slow-dealing lines' on the shelves. Their permanent
staff of armourers and constructional experts are able to undertake all but very
major repairs to the ordnance that comes under their charge. By express delivery&mdash;heavy
motor haulage&mdash;they can equip a ship on instant requisition with
all that is scheduled for her armament: down to the waste-box and the gun-layer's
sea-boots, they can put a complete defensive outfit on the road almost
before the clamour of a requesting telephone is stilled.</p>

<p>Another of our staff is the officer in charge of our 'Otter' installation, an
ingenious contrivance to protect us against the menace of moored mines. For
deadly spheres floating on the surface we have a certain measure of defence in
exercise of a keen look-out, but our eyes avail us not at all in detecting mines
under water moored at the level of our draught. Our 'Otters' may be likened
to blind sea-dolphins, trained to protect our flanks, to run silently aside, fend
the explosive charges from our course, bite the moorings asunder, and throw
the bobbing spheres to the surface.</p>

<p>The 'Otter' expert is invariably an enthusiast. He claims for his pets every
virtue. They run true, they bite surely: they can speak, indeed, in the complaint
of their guide-wires when they are not sympathetically governed. While it is
true that we curse the awkward 'gadgets' in their multitude of tricks, denounce
the insistence with which they dive for a snug and immovable berth under our
bilge keels&mdash;those of us who have come through a hidden minefield share the
expert's affection for the shiny fish-like monsters. We cannot see their operation:
we have no knowledge of our danger till it is past and over, a dark shape
with ugly outpointing horns, turning and spinning in the seawash of our wake.</p>

</div>

<p>Adoption of the convoy system has brought a host to our gangways. Our
war staff was more than doubled in the few weeks that followed the sinister
April of 1917. If, at an earlier date, we had reasonable ground for complaint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that our expert knowledge of our business was studiously ignored by the
Admiralty, apparently they did not rate our ability so lightly when this old
form of ship protection was revived. The additions to our staff included a
large proportion of our own officers, withdrawn from posts where their knowledge
of merchant-ship practice was not of great value. In convoy, measures were
called for that our ordinary routine had not contemplated. The shore division
of our new staff aid us in adapting our commercial sea-gear to the more instant
demands of war service. They 'clear our hawse' from turns and twists in
the chain of our landward connections. Repairs and adjustments, crew troubles,
stores&mdash;that on a strict ruling may be deemed private matters&mdash;became public
and important when considered as vital to the sailing of a convoy. In overseeing
the ships at the starting-line, indexing and listing the varying classes and
powers of the vessels, the convoy section have no light task. To the longshore
division, who compose and arrange the integrals of our convoys, we have
added a sea-staff of commodores, R.N. and R.N.R., who go to sea with us and
control the man&oelig;uvres and operations of our ships in station. For this, not
only a knowledge of squadron movements is required: the ruling of a convoy
of merchantmen is complicated as much by the range of character of individual
masters as by the diverse capabilities of the ships.</p>

<p>It was not until the spring of 1917 that Admiralty instituted a scheme of
instruction in anti-submarine measures for officers of the Merchants' Service. We
were finding the defensive tune difficult to pick up as we marched. The German
submarine had grown to be a more complete and deadly warship. Sinkings had
reached an alarming height: a spirit almost of fatalism was permeating the
sea-actions of some of our Service. Our guns were of little avail against under-water
attack. Notwithstanding the tricks of our zigzag, the torpedoes struck
home on our hulls. If our luck was 'in,' we came through: if we had bad
fortune, well, our luck was 'out'! A considerable school&mdash;the bold 'make-a-dash-for-it-and-chance-the-ducks'
section of our fellows&mdash;did not wholly
conform to naval instructions. In many cases zigzag was but cursorily maintained;
in darkening ship, measures were makeshift and inadequate.</p>

<p>Schools for our instruction were set up at various centres, in convenient seaport
districts. At the first, attendance was voluntary, but it was quickly evident
to the Admiralty that certain classes of owners would give few facilities to their
officers to attend, when they might be more profitably employed in keeping
gangway or in supervising cargo stowage. (The fatalistic spirit was not confined
to the seagoers among us.) Attendance at the classes of instruction was made
compulsory; it became part of our qualification for office that we should have
completed the course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Although our new schooling occupies but five days, it is intensive in its scope
and application. The cold print of our official instructions has its limitations,
and Admiralty circulars are not perhaps famous for lucidity. More can be done
by a skilled interpreter with a blackboard in a few minutes than could be gathered
in half an hour's reading. At first assembly there is perhaps an atmosphere of
boredom. Routine details and a programme of operations are hardly welcome
to masters accustomed to command. In a way, we have condescended to come
among our juniors, to listen with the mates and second mates to what may be
said: we assume, perhaps, a detached air of constraint.</p>

<p>It is no small tribute to the lecturer that this feeling rarely persists beyond
the opening periods. Only the most perversely immovable can resist the interest
of a practical demonstration. The classes are under charge of an officer, R.N.,
who has had deep-sea experience of enemy submarine activities. Often he is
of the 'Q-ship' branch, and can enliven his lectures with incidents that
show us a side of the sea-contest with which not many are familiar. If we are
informed of the deadly advantage of the submarine, we are equally enlightened
as to its limitations. In a few minutes, by virtue of a plot on the blackboard,
the vantage of a proper zigzag is made clear and convincing. Points of view&mdash;in
a literal sense&mdash;are expounded, and not a few of us recall our placing of look-outs
and register a better plan. Following the officer in charge, a lieutenant
of the Submarine Service dissects his vessel on the blackboard, carefully detailing
the action in states of weather and circumstance. The under-water man&oelig;uvres
of an attack are plotted out and explained in a practical way that no handbook
could rival. The personal magnetism of the expert rivets our attention;
the routine of under-seafaring gives us a good inkling of the manner of man we
have to meet and fight at sea; we are given an insight to the mind-working of
our unseen opponent&mdash;the brain below the periscope is probed and examined
for our education.</p>

<p>Nothing could be better illustrative of the wide character of our seafaring
than the range of our muster in the lecture-hall. Every type of our trade
appears in the class that assembles weekly to attend the instructional course.
We have no grades of seniority or precedence. We are sea-republicans when
we come to sit together in class. Hardy coasting masters, commanders of
Royal Mail Packets, collier mates, freighter captains, cross-Channel skippers,
we are at ease together in a common cause; on one bench in the classroom
may be seafarers returned from foreign ports as widely distant as Shanghai and
Valparaiso.</p>

<p>For instruction in gunnery and the use of special apparatus we come under
tuition of a type of seaman whom we had not met before. If the backbone of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the Army is the non-commissioned man, the petty officer of the Royal Navy is
no less the marrow of his Service. Unfortunately, we have no one like him in
the Merchants' Service. As Scots is the language of marine engines, the South
of England accent may be that of the guns. That liquid &uuml;! "Metal adapters,
genelmen, l&uuml;k. Metal adapters is made o' al&uuml;minium bronze. They are bored
ho&uuml;t t' take a t&uuml;be, an' threaded on th' ho&uuml;tside t' screw into th' base o' th'
cartridge case&mdash;like this 'ere. Genelmen, l&uuml;k.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." His intelligent demonstration
of the gear and working of the types of our armament possesses a peculiar
quality, as though he is trying hard to reduce his exposition to our level. (As
a matter of plain fact, he is.)</p>

<p>The instructional course closes on a note of confidence. We learn that even
'inexorable circumstance' has an opening to skilled evasion. We go afloat
for a day and put into practice some measure of our schooling. At fire-control,
with the guns, we exercise in an atmosphere of din and burnt cardboard, aiming
at a hit with the fifth shot in sequence of our bracket. (An earlier bull's-eye
would be bad application of our lectures.) A smoke-screen is set up for our
benefit, and we turn and twist in the artificially produced fumes and vapours
in a practical demonstration of defence. A sea-going submarine is in attendance
and is open to our inspection. Her officers augment the class instruction by
actual showing. Every point in the maze of an under-water attack is emphasized
by them in an effort to impress us with the virtue of the counter-measures
advised. It must be hard indeed for the submarine enthusiast (and they are
all enthusiasts) to lay bare the 'weaknesses' of his loved machine. We feel
for them almost as if we heard a man, under pressure, admit that his last ship
was unseaworthy.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<h3>THE LONGSHORE VIEW</h3>


<div class='cap'>EARLY in November 1914, on return from the sea, I was invited to join
His Majesty's Forces.</div>

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. An' I can tell you this, mister," said the sergeant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "it
ain't everybody as I asks t' join our corps.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Adjutant, 'e ses t' me
this mornin', 'Looka here, Bates,' 'e ses, 'don't you go for to bring none
o' them scallywags 'ere! We don't want 'em! We won't 'ave 'em at
any price,' 'e ses!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 'Wot we wants is proper men&mdash;men with chests,'
'e ses!"</p>

<p>I felt somewhat commended; I trimmed more upright in carriage; he was
certainly a clever recruiter. I told him I had rather important work to do.
He said, with emphasis, that it must be more than important to keep a <span class="smcap">man</span>
out of the Army&mdash;these days! In sound of shrieking newsboys&mdash;"<i>Ant&mdash;werp
fallen! British falling back!</i>"&mdash;I agreed.</p>

<p>I asked him what he did with the men recruited. He was somewhat surprised
at my question, but told me that, when trained, they were sent across to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Front&mdash;he was hoping to <i>return</i> himself in the next draft. He thought all this
talk was needless, and grew impatient. I mentioned that the men couldn't
very well swim over there. He glared scornfully. "Swim?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Swim!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
'Ere! Wot th' hell ye gettin' at? You gotta hellova lot t' say about it,
anyway!"</p>

<p>I explained that my business was that of putting the troops and the guns
and the gear o' war across; that the drafts couldn't get very far on the way
without our assistance. He glanced at my soft felt hat, at my rainproof coat,
my umbrella, my handbag&mdash;said, "<i>Huh</i>" and went off in search of a more
promising recruit. His broad back, as he strode off swinging his cane, expressed
an entire disapproval of my appearance and my alleged business.</p>

<p>Good honest sergeant! His course was a clear and straight one. He would
hold no more truck with one who wouldn't take up a man's job. His "Huh"
and the swing of his arm said plainly to me, "Takin' th' boys across, eh?
A &mdash;&mdash; fine excuse, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a rare &mdash;&mdash; trick! Where's yer uniform? Why ain't
ye in uniform, eh? You can't do me with that story, mister! I'm an old
Service man, I am. I been out t' India. I been on a troopship. I seen all
them gold-lace blokes a-pokin' their noses about an' growsin' at th' way th'
decks wos kep! <i>Huh!</i> A damn slacker, mister! That's wot I think o'
you!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The sergeant's attitude was not unreasonable. Where was our uniform?
Where was any evidence of our calling by which one could recognize a seaman
on shore? A sea-gait, perhaps! But the deep-sea roll has gone out since bilge-keels
came to steady our vessels! Tattoo marks? These cunning personal
adornments are now reserved to the Royal Artillery and officers of the Indian
Army! Tarry hands? Tar is as scarce on a modern steamer as strawberries
in December! Sea-togs? If there be a preference, we have a fondness for
blue serge, but blue serges have quite a vogue among bankers and merchants
and other men of substance! Away from our ships and the dockside waterfront,
we are not readily recognizable; we join the masses of other workers,
we become members of the general public. As such, we may lay claim to a
common liberty, and look at our seafaring selves from an average point of longshore
view.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The sea? Oh, we know a lot about it! It is in us. We pride ourselves,
an island race, we have the sea in our blood, we are born to it. Circumstances
may have brought us to counting-house and ledger, but our heart is
with the sea. We use, unwittingly, many nautical terms in our everyday life.
We had been to sea at times, on a business voyage or for health or pleasure. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
knew the captain and the mates and the engineers. The chief steward was a
friend, the bos'n or quartermaster had shown us the trick of a sheepshank or a
reef-knot or a short splice. Their ways of it! Port and starboard for left and
right, knots for miles, eight bells, the watches, and all that! We returned from
our sea-trip, parted with our good friends, feeling hearty and refreshed. We
hummed, perhaps, a scrap of a sea-song at the ledgers. We regretted that our
sea-day had come so quickly to an end. Anyway, we felt that we had got to
know the sea-people intimately.</p>

<p>But that was on their ground, on the sea and the ship, where they fitted to
the scheme of things and were as readily understood and appreciated as the little
round port-holes, the narrow bunks, the cunning tip-up washstands, the rails
for hand-grip in a storm. Their atmosphere, their stories, their habits, were
all part of our sea-piece. Taken from their heaving decks and the round of a
blue horizon, they seemed to go out of our reckoning. On shore? Of course
they must at times come on shore, but somehow one doesn't know much about
them there. There are our neighbours.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes! Gudgeon's eldest boy, he
is at sea&mdash;a mate or a purser. He has given over wearing his brass buttons
and a badge cap now: we see him at long intervals, when he comes home to
prepare for examinations. A hefty sort of lad&mdash;shouldn't think he would do
much in the way of study; a bit wild perhaps. Then Mrs. Smith's husband.
Isn't he at sea, a captain or a chief engineer, or something? He comes among
us occasionally; travels to town, now and then, in our carriage. A hearty man&mdash;uses
rather strong language, though! Has not a great deal to say of things&mdash;no
interest in politics, in the market, in the games. Never made very much
of him. Don't see him at the clubs. Seems to spend all his time at home. At
home! Oh yes; wasn't it only the other day his small daughter told ours her
daddy was <i>going</i> home again on Saturday!</p>

<p>In war, we are learning. There are no more games; contentious politics
are not for these days; the markets and business are difficult and wayward.
We are come to see our dependence on the successful voyages of Mrs. Smith's
husband. His coming among us, from time to time, is proof that our links
with the world overseas are yet unbroken, that there may still be business to
transact when we turn up at the office. Strangely, in the new clarity of a war
vision, we see his broad back in our harvest-fields, as we had never noticed it
before. He is almost one of our staff. He handles our goods, our letters,
our gold, our securities, our daily bread. His business is now so near to us
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But no! It cannot properly be done. We recall that there <i>is</i> one way for
our ready recognition when we come on shore these days. We cannot appropriate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a longshore point of view, we cannot conceal our seafaring and merge
into the crowd. There <i>is</i> a mark&mdash;our tired eyes, as we come off the sea! True,
there are now, sadly, many tired eyes on the beach, but few carry the distant
focus, the peculiar intentness brought about by absence of perspective at
sea. We cannot adopt a public outlook owing to this obliquity in our vision,
we are barred by the persistence of that vexed perspective in our views
on shore.</p>

<p>Still, the point may be raised that only in our actual seafaring are we recognized.
We are poor citizens, nomads, who have little part with settled grooves
and communal life on shore. The naval seaman is a known figure on the streets.
His trim uniform, the cut of his hair, the swing of a muscular figure, his high
spirits, are all in part with a stereotyped conception. He is the sailor; Mercantile
Jack has lost his tradition in attire and individuality, he has vanished from the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hard'">herd</ins> with his high-heeled shoes, coloured silk neckerchief, and sweet-tobacco
hat.</p>

<p>In the round of shore communications there is exercise for assessing a measure
of the other man's work: a large proportion of success hinges on easy fellowship,
on an understanding and acquaintance not only with the technics of another's
trade, but with his habits and his pursuits. All trades, all businesses, all professions
have relations, near or distant, with the sea, but to them our grades
and descriptions are dubious and uncertain. For this we are to blame. We are
bad advertisers. We are content to leave our fraternization with the beach to
the far distant day when we shall retire from the sea-service, 'swallow the
anchor,' and settle down to longshore life. We cannot join and rejoin the
guilderies on shore in the intervals of our voyaging. We preserve a grudging
silence on our seafaring, perhaps tint what pictures we do present in other lights
than verity. The necessary aloofness of our calling makes for a seclusion in
our affairs: we make few efforts to remedy an estrangement; in a way, we
adopt the disciplinary scourge of the flagellants, we glory in our isolation. If
we share few of the institutions that exist for fellowship ashore, we have
made no bid for admittance: if the tide of intercourse leaves us stranded,
we have put out no steering oar on the drift of the flood. We are somewhat
diffident. Perhaps we are influenced by a certain reputation that is
still attached to us. Are we the prodigals not yet in the mood to turn unto
our fathers?</p>

<p>Stout old Doctor Johnson enlarged on the sea-life&mdash;of his day&mdash;with a determination
and no small measure of accuracy. "Sir," he said, "a ship is worse
than a gaol. There is in a gaol better air, better company, better conveniency
of every kind; and a ship has the additional disadvantage of being in danger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
When men come to like a sea-life they are not fit to live on land.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Men go
to the sea before they know the unhappiness of that way of life; and when they
have come to know it, they cannot escape from it, because it is then too late
to choose another profession." At least he admitted the possibility of some of
us coming to <i>like</i> a sea-life, though his postulate conveyed no high opinion of
our intelligence in such a preference.</p>

<p>We have travelled far since the worthy Doctor's day. Not all his dicta
may stand. There is still, perhaps, greater danger in a ship than in gaol, but
Johnson himself admitted that "the profession of sailors has the dignity of
danger"! For the rest, our air has become so good that invalids are ordered to
sea; our conveniences are notably improved, our ships the last word in strength
and comfort. Our company? Our company fits to the heave of our sea. If
we have middling men for the trough, we have bold gallants for the crest. We
draw a wide range to our service. The sea can offer a good career to a prizeman:
we can still do moderately well with the wayward boy, the parents' 'heart-break,'
the lad with whom nothing can be done on shore. Steam has certainly
given a new gentility to our seafaring, but it cannot wholly smooth out the
uneven sea-road. If we lose an amount of polish, of distinguished association,
of education in our recruitment, we may gain just that essence that fits a man
for our calling. Our company is, at any rate, stout and resolute, and, without
that, we had long since been under German bondage.</p>

<span class="caption">THE MERSEY FROM THE LIVER BUILDINGS, LIVERPOOL</span>
</div>

<p>The war has brought a new prominence to our sea-trade. The public has
become interested not alone in our sea-ventures, but in our landward doings.
The astonishing fact of our civilian combatance has drawn a recognition
that no years of peace could have uncovered. Not least of the revelations that
the world conflict has imposed is the vital importance of the ships. Our naval
fleets were ever talked of, read of, gloried in, as the spring of our national power,
but not many saw the core of our sea-strength in the stained hulls of the
merchants' ships. They were accepted without enthusiasm as an existing trade
channel; they were there on a round of business and trade, not dissimilar to
other transport services&mdash;the railways, road-carriage, the inland canals, the
moving-van, the messengers. They were ready to hand for service; so near
that their vital proportions were not readily apparent. Perhaps the greatest
compliment the public has paid to the Merchants' Service lay in this abstract
view. One saw an appreciation, perhaps unspoken, in the consternation that
greeted the first irregularity in delivery of the oversea mails. Then, indeed,
the importance of the ships was brought sharply home. It was incredible:
it was unheard of. Mercantile practice and correspondence had outgrown all
duplications and weatherly precautions; the service was so sure and uninterrupted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that no need existed for a second string to the bow. Bills of exchange,
indents, invoices, the mail-letter, had long been confided to sea-carriage on one
bottom. Pages could be written of the tangled skeins, the complex situations,
the confusion and congestion that were all brought about by extra mileage of
an ocean voyage. Fortunes, not alone in hulls and cargo, lie with our wreckage
on the floor of the channels.</p>

<p>The sea-front suddenly assumed an importance in the general view, as the
drain on our tonnage left vacant shelves in the bakehouse. Commodities that,
so common and plentiful, had been lightly valued, were out of stock&mdash;the ships
had not come in! Long queues formed at the shop doors, seeking and questioning&mdash;their
topic, the fortunes of the ships! The table was rearranged in keeping
with a depleted larder. Anxious eyes turned first in the morning to the list of
our sea-casualties; the ships, what of the ships? The valiant deeds of our
armies, the tide and toll of battles, could wait a second glance. Not all the
gallantry of our arms could bring victory if our sea-communications were
imperilled or restrained; on the due arrival of the ships centred the pivot of
our operations.</p>

<p>Joined to the fortune of the ships, interest was drawn to the seamen. A
new concern arose. Who were the mariners who had to face these deadly perils
to keep our sea-lines unbroken? Were they trained to arms? How could
they stand to the menace that had so shocked our naval forces? Daily the
toll rose. Savagery, undreamt of, succeeded mere shipwreck: murder, assassination,
mutilation became commonplace on the sea. Who were the mercantile
seamen; of what stock, what generation?</p>

<p>To a degree we were embarrassed at such new attention. The mystery of
sea-life, we felt, had unbalanced the public view. Our stock, our generation,
was the same as that of the tailors and the candlestick-makers who were standing
the enemy on his head on the Flanders fields; we differed not greatly from the
haberdasher and the baby-linen man who drove the Prussian Guard, the proudest
soldier in Europe, from the reeking shambles of Contalmaison. Indeed, we had
advantage in our education for a fight. Our training, if not military, was
at least directed to mass operations in contest with power of the elements:
torpedo and mine were but additions to the perils of our regular trade.
If the clerk and the grocer could rise from ordered peaceful ways and set the
world ringing with his gallantry and heroism, we were poltroons indeed to
flinch and falter at the familiar conduct of our seafaring. We felt that our
share in warfare was as nothing to the blaze of fury on the battle-fronts, our
sea-life was comparative comfort in contrast to the grisly horrors of the
trenches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>With universal service, opportunity for acquaintance with our life and our
work was extended beyond the numbers of chance passengers. The exodus
oversea of the nation's manhood brought the landsman and the seaman together
as no casual meeting on the streets could have done. Millions of our country-men,
who had never dreamed of outlook on blue water bounded by line of an
unbroken horizon, have found themselves brought into close contact with us,
living our life, assisting in many of our duties, facing the same dangers. In
such a firm fellowship and communion of interest there cannot but be a bond
between us that shall survive the passage of high-water mark.</p>

<h3>CONNECTION WITH THE STATE</h3>


<h3><br />TRINITY HOUSE, OUR ALMA MATER</h3>

<div class='cap'>OF all trades, seafaring ever required a special governance, a unique
Code of Laws, suited to the seaman's isolation from tribunal and land
court, to the circumstance of his constant voyaging. On sea, the
severance from ordered government, from reward as from penalty, was irremediable
and complete. No common law or enactment could be enforced on
the wandering sea-tribesmen who owned no settled domicile, who responded only
to the weight of a stronger arm than their own, who had an impenetrable cloak
to their doings in the mystery of distant seas. The spirit and high heart that
had called them to the dangers and vicissitudes of a sea-life would not brook
tamely the dominance and injunction of a power whose authority was, at sea,
invisible&mdash;and even under the land, could carry but little distance beyond high-water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
mark. To the bold self-enterprise of the early sea-venturers, the unconfined
ocean offered a free field for a standard of strength, for a law of might alone.
Kings and Princes might rule the boundaries of the land, but the sea was for
those who could maintain a holding on the troubled waters. Were the 'Rectores'
not Kings on their own heaving decks, their province the round of the horizon,
their subjects the vulgar 'shippe-men,' their slaves the unfortunate weaker seafarers,
whom chance or the fickle winds had brought within reach of their sea-arms?
The sea-rovers were difficult to bridle or restrain. <i>Spurlos versenkt</i>
might well have been their motto&mdash;as that of later pirates. No trace! The sea
would tell no tales. They were alone on the breadth of the ocean, no ordered
protection was within hail, the land lay distant under rim of the sea-line. Blue
water would wash over the face of robbery and crime: the hazards of the sea
could well account for a missing ship!</div>

<p>Reverse the setting and the same uncharity could similarly be masked. In
turn, the humanity the seamen contemned was denied to them. Driven on
shore, wrecked or foundered on coast or shoal, the laws they scorned were powerless
to shield or salve the wreckage of their vessels, to save their weary sea-scarred
bodies. 'No trace' was equally a motto for the dwellers on the coast: blue
water would wash as freely over their bloody evidence, the miserable castaways
could be as readily returned to the pitiless sea: an equal hazard of the deep could
as surely account for missing men!</p>

<p>Only special measures could control a situation of such a desperate nature,
no ordinary governance could effect a settlement; no one but a powerful and
kingly seafarer could frame an adjustment and post wardens to enforce a law
for the sea. When Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion established our first Maritime Code,
he had his own rude sea-experience to guide him. On perilous voyaging to the
Holy Land, he must have given more than passing thought to the trials and
dangers of his rough mariners. Sharing their sea-life and its hardships, he noted
the ship-measures and rude sea-justice with a discerning and humane appreciation.
In all the records of our law-making there are few such intimate revelations
of a minute understanding as his R&ocirc;les d'Ol&eacute;ron. The practice of to-day
reflects no small measure of his wisdom; in their basic principles, his charges
still tincture the complex fabric of our modern Sea Codes. Bottomry&mdash;the
pledging of ship and tackle to procure funds for provision or repair;
salvage&mdash;a just and reasonable apportionment; jettison&mdash;the sharing of
another's loss for a common good; damage to ship or cargo&mdash;the account
of liability: many of his ordinances stand unaltered in substance, if varied
and amplified in detail.</p>

<p>The spirit of these medi&aelig;val Shipping Acts was devoted as well to restrain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the lawless doings of the seamen as to check the inhuman plunderings of the
coast dwellers. The rights and duties of master and man were clearly defined:
in the schedule of penalties, the master's forfeit was enhanced, as his was assumed
to be the better intelligence. For barratry and major sea-crimes, the penalty
was death and dismemberment. All pilots who wrecked their charges for benefit
of the lords of the sea-coast were to be hung on a gibbet, and so exhibited to
all men, near the spot where the vessels they had misdirected were come on shore.
The lord of the foreshore who connived at their acts was to suffer a dire fate.
He was to be burned on a stake at his own hearthstone, the walls of his mansion
to be razed, and the standing turned to a market-place for barter of swine!
Drastic punishment! Doubtless kingly Richard drew abhorrence for the
wrecker from his own bitter experience on the inhospitable rocky coast of Istria!</p>

<p>Little detail has come down to us of the means adopted to enforce these just
acts. Of the difficulties of their enforcement we may judge a little from the
character of the seamen as presented by contemporary chronicles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Full many a draught of wyn had he drawe</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;"><i>From Burdeux-ward, whil that the chapman sleep.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;"><i>Of nyce conscience took he no keep.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;"><i>If that he foughte, and hadde the heigher hand,</i></span><br />

</div>

<div class='unindent'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thus Chaucer; but Chaucer was a Collector of Customs, and would possibly
assess the stolen draught of Bordeaux as a greater crime than throwing prisoners
overboard! From evidence of the date, Richard's shipping laws seem to have
been but lightly regarded by the lords of the foreshore. In the reign of King
John, wrecking had become a practice so common that prescriptive rights to
the litter of the beaches was included in manorial charters, despite the R&ocirc;le
that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "the pieces of the ship still to belong to the original owners, notwithstanding
any custom to the contrary .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and any participators of the said
wrecks, whether they be bishops, prelates, or clerks, shall be deposed and deprived
of their benefices, and if lay people they are to incur the penalties previously
recited."</div>

<p>It was surely by more than mere chance the churchmen were thus specially
indicted! Perhaps it was by a temporal as well as a spiritual measure that Stephen
Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, strove to remove a reproach to the Church.
He founded a Guild of sea-samaritans, a Corporation</p>

<div class="blockquot">"of godly disposed men, who, for the actual suppression of evil disposed
persons bringing ships to destruction by the shewing forth of false beacons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
do bind themselves together in the Love of our Lord Christ, in the name
of the Masters and Fellows of Trinity Guild to succour from the dangers
of the sea all who are beset upon the coasts of England, to feed them when
ahungered and athirst, to bind up their wounds, and to build and light
proper beacons for the guidance of mariners."</div>

<div class='unindent'>An earnest and compassionate Charter: a merciful and honourable Commission.</div>

<p>In this wise was formed our Alma Mater, the ancient guild of shipmen and
mariners of England. Subsequent charters advanced their titles as they enlarged
their duties and charges. In 1514, Henry VIII confirmed their foundation
under style of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Master, Wardens, and Accistants of the Guild or
Fraternity of the Most Glorious and Undivided Trinity, and of St. Clement,
in the Parish of Deptford Strond, in the County of Kent." Some years later,
the 'accistants' were subdivided as Elder and Younger Brethren, the Foundation
being familiarly referred to as the Corporation of Trinity House.</p>

<p>In early days, their efforts were directed in charity to stricken seafarers,
in humane dispensation, in erection and maintenance of sea-marks, in training
and provision of competent sea and coast pilots&mdash;a line of endeavour directed
by the Godly Primate, in his Commission. Beacons were built on dangerous
points of the coast, keepers appointed to serve them, watchers detailed to observe
the vessels as they passed and restrain the activities of the wrecker. The
magnitude of the task, the difficulties of their office, the powerful counter-influences
arrayed against their beneficent r&ocirc;le, may be judged by an incident
that occurred as late as little over a hundred and twenty years ago.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "When
Ramsgate Harbour, as a port of refuge from storm and stress, was intended, and
the business was before Parliament, a petition from the Lord of the Manor
tended to accelerate matters. He represented to the House, while the Bill
was depending, that, <i>as the wrecks on the coast belonged to him and formed a
considerable part of his property, he prayed that the Bill would not pass!</i>  "</p>

<p>Established in charity for the guardianship of the coasts, the Brethren of
Trinity passed to a supervision of the ships and the seamen. Although a closely
guarded Corporation, qualifications for entry were simply those of sea-knowledge.
The business of shipping, if more hazardous and difficult on the sea,
was less complicated in its landward connections than is its modern conduct.
The merchants were well content to be guided in their affairs by their sea-partners,
the men who actually commanded and sailed the ships. The voyages,
ship construction, refitment and victualling were matters that could only
be advised by the skilled seamen. Jealous for professional advancement,
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Brethern'">Brethren</ins> of Trinity held their ranks open only to skilled master seamen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and to kindred sea-tradesmen&mdash;the shipwrights and rope-makers. While attracting
leaders and statesmen to the higher and more ornamental offices,
control was largely vested in the Elder and Younger Brethren&mdash;technical advisers,
competent to understand sea-matters.</p>

<p>In no small measure, the rise and supremacy of our shipping is due to their
wise direction and control. They were the sole machinery of the State for control
of the ships and the seaman. Survey and inspection of sea-stores, planning
and supervision of ship construction, registry and measurement of vessels, had
their beginning in the orderly efforts of the Brethren. Examination of the competence
of masters was part of their duties&mdash;as was their arbitration in crew
disputes. They licensed and supplied seafarers of all classes to the 'King's
Ships,' tested their ordnance and examined the ammunition. Their reading of
the ancient charter of their foundation was wide and liberal in its scope&mdash;"<i>to
build, and light proper beacons for the guidance of mariners</i>" was their
understanding. In construction and equipment and maintenance of sea-marks,
in licence and efficient service of their coastal pilots, they carried out to the letter
the text of their covenant; in spirit, they understood a guidance that was
less material if equally important. Their beacons were not alone standing
structures of stone and lime, but world-marks in precept and ordinance, in study
and research. They held bright cressets aloft to illuminate the difficult seaways
in the paths of navigation and science of the seafarer. They placed
facilities for the study of seamanship before the mariners and sought to advance
the science of navigation in line with the efforts of our sea-competitors. The
charts and maps of the day&mdash;most of them being rude Dutch draft sheets&mdash;were
improved and corrected, and new surveys of the coastal waters were undertaken at
charge and patronage of the Brethren. Captain Greenville Collins, Hydrographer
to Charles II, bears witness to their high ideals in presenting to the Corporation
the fruits of his seven years' labour in survey and charting of the coast. The
preface to his work is made noteworthy by his reference to the practice of the
day&mdash;the haphazard alterations on the charts that brought many a fine ship to
grief.</p>

<div class="blockquot">".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I then, as in Duty bound (being a Younger Brother) did acquaint
you with it, and most humbly laid the Proposals before you; whereupon
you were pleased not only to approve of them, but did most bountifully
advance towards the charge of the work.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I could heartily wish that
it might be so ordered by your Corporation, that all Masters of Ships, both
using Foreign and Home Voyages, might be encouraged to bring you in their
Journals, and a Person appointed to inspect them; which would be a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Improvement of Navigation, by imparting their Observations and Discoveries
of the true Form and Prospect of the Sea Coast .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and other
dangerous Places.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And that those Persons who make and sell Sea
Charts and Maps, were not allowed to alter them upon the single Report
of Mariners, but with your approbation; by which means our Sea Charts
would be more correct and the common Scandal of their Badness removed."</div>

<p>In all her enactments and activities, our Alma Mater ever preserved a worthy
pride in her sons. Enthusiasm for a gallant profession, patronage for advancement
in sea-skill and learning, a keen and studied interest in whatever tended
to elevate and ennoble the calling of the sea, were her inspiring sentiment. Even
in wise reproof and cautionary advice, her words were tempered by a brave note
of pride&mdash;as though, under so many difficulties and serious dangers, she gloried
in our work being worthily undertaken. In charge to the seaman, Captain
Collins continues his kindly preface:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It sometimes happens, and that too frequently, that when Ships which
have made long and dangerous Voyages, and are come Home richly laden,
have been shipwrecked on their native Coast, whereby both Merchants,
Owners, and Mariners have been impoverished. All our neighbours will
acknowledge, that no Nation abounds more with skilful and experienced
Seamen than our own; none meeting a Danger with more Courage and
Bravery .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so a Master of a ship has a very great Charge, and ought
to be a sober Man, as well as a skilful Mariner: All Helps of Art, Care,
and Circumspection are to be used by him, that the Lives of Mariners (the
most useful of their Majesties' Subjects at this juncture) and the Fortunes
of honest Merchants under his Care may be preserved."</p></div>

<span class="caption">AT GRAVESEND: PILOTS AWAITING AN INWARD-BOUND CONVOY</span>
</div>

<p>For over three hundred years, our Alma Mater flourished as the spring of
our seafaring&mdash;a noble and venerable Corporation, concerned solely and alone
with the sea and the ships and the seamen. The Brethren saw only one aim
for their endeavours&mdash;the supremacy of the sea-trade, the business by which
the nation stood or fell. Nor was theirs an inactive part in all the long sea-wars
and crises that reacted on our commerce. Before a navy existed, the stout
old master-seamen of Deptford Strond were charged with the sea-defences of
the capital. The new naval forces came under their control at a later date,
and we have the record of an efficiency in administration that showed prevision
and thought well in advance of that of their landward contemporaries. Piracy,
privateering, the restraints of rulers and princes, were dealt with in their day.
At critical turns in the courses of our naval conduct, it was to the steersmen of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Trinity that the Ministers of the State relied for prompt and seamanlike action.
The 'sea to the seamen' was the rule. Adapting their resources to the needs
of the day, the Brethren were held fast by no conventional restraint. They
assisted peaceful developments in trade in the quieter years, but could as readily
mobilize for war service under threat of invasion, or turn their skilled activities
to removal of the sea-marks to prevent the sailing of a mutinous fleet. In the
long and stormy history of Trinity House there were many precedents to guide
the action of the Brethren on the outbreak of war. As guardians of the sea-channels
and the approaches to our coasts, they manned these misty sea-trenches
on the outbreak of war in 1914. Weaponless, by exercise of a skill in pilotage and
a resolution worthy of great traditions, the Trinity men have held that menaced
line intact. That little has been said about their great work is perhaps a tradition
of their service.</p>

<p>We are parted now. The Merchants' Service is no longer a studied and valued
interest of the ancient corporation. In an assured position as arbiters between
the State and the shipping industry, the Trinity Brethren could combine a just
regard for the merchants' interest with a generous and understanding appreciation
of the seamen's trials and difficulties. If for no other reason than the record
of past endeavours, they should still control the personnel of the Merchants'
Service, in regulating the scheme of our education, the scope of our qualification
for office, the grades of our service, the essence of our sea-conduct. But in the
fickle doldrums of the period when steam superseded sail as our motive power,
we drifted apart. Shipping interests have become complicated with land
ventures, as widely different from them as the marine engine is from our former
sail plan. In 1850 the Merchants' Service was placed under control of the Board
of Trade; we were handed over to a Board that is no Board&mdash;a department of
the State with little, if any, sea-sentiment, and that is sternly resolved to repress
all our efforts to regain a voice in the control of our own affairs.</p>


<h3><br />THE BOARD OF TRADE</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">If</span> we may claim the ancient Corporation of Trinity House as the Alma Mater
of the Merchants' Service, we may liken our comparatively new directorate, the
Board of Trade, to our Alma step-Mater&mdash;an austere, bureaucratic dame, hard-working
and earnest, perhaps, but lacking the kindly spirit of a sea-tradition.
She is utterly out of touch and sympathy with a sea-sense&mdash;her arms, overstrained
perhaps by the tremendous burden of charge upon charge that comes to her for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
settlement, are never open to the seamen. Sullenly, we resent her dictation
as that of a usurper&mdash;a lay impropriator of our professional heritage. Under
her coldly formal direction, we may attend our affairs in diligence and prudence,
but for us there is no motherly licence; she has no pride in our doings (if one
counts not the vicious insistence of her statistics)&mdash;we are only the stepchildren
of her adoption, odd men of the huge and hybrid family over whom she has been
set to cast a suspicious, if guardian, eye. While Trinity House was concerned
alone with the conduct of shipping and sea-affairs, our new controllers of the Board
of Trade have interests in charge as widely apart as the feeding of draught-horses
and the examination of a bankrupt cheesemonger. We are but a Department.
The sea-service of the nation, the key industry of our island commerce, is governed
by a subdivision in a Ministry that has long outgrown the limits of a central
and answerable control. Instead of settlement by a contained and competent
Ministry of Marine, our highly technical sea-conduct is ruled for us in queue
with longshore affairs, sandwiched, perhaps, between horse-racing and the period
of the dinner table.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>The President of the Board of Trade has intimated to the Stewards of the
National Hunt Committee that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is not possible to sanction a list of
fixtures for the season.</i>"</p>

<p>"Mr. Peto asked the President of the Board of Trade whether his attention
has been called to the decision of Mr. Justice Rowlatt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in
which judgment was given for the plaintiff company, owners of the steamship
X&mdash;&mdash;, sunk in collision, due to steaming without lights."</p>

<p>"<i>The President of the Board of Trade announces modifications of the Lighting
Order during the present week, one effect being that the prohibition of the serving
of meals in hotels after 9.30 p.m. is temporarily suspended.</i>"</p></div>

<p>Perhaps we were rather spoilt by the pride that was in us when our seafaring
was ruled by the appreciative Brethren of Trinity, and it may be as a repressive
measure of discipline the Board of Trade extends no particular favour to our
sea-trade, and has indeed gone further in being at pains to belittle our sea-deeds,
and disparage a recognition of our status. Our controllers are anxious that
their ruling of award and reward should suffer no comparison. For gallantry
at sea, the grades of their recognition may vary from the Silver Medal (delivered,
perhaps, as in a recent case, with the morning's milk) to a sextant or a pair of
binoculars.</p>

<p>In 1905 a very gallant rescue was effected by the men of the Liverpool steamer
<i>Augustine</i>. The crew of a Greek vessel were taken from their foundering ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in mid-Atlantic under circumstances of great peril. Not only was boat service
performed in tempestuous weather, but the officers of <i>Augustine</i> themselves
jumped overboard to try to save the Greek seamen, who were too far exhausted
to hold on to the life-lines and buoys thrown to them. The King of Greece, in
recognition of the gallantry and humanity displayed, signed a decree conferring
on the British master and his officers the Gold Decoration of the Redeemer.</p>

<p>A general view would be that this was an award quite appropriate to the
services rendered, an expression by the Greek Government that they wished
to place the names of the gallant savers of their seamen on the Roll of their
Honour. Our Board of Trade objected. Through the Foreign Office, they
appear to have informed the Greek Government that such distinguished awards
were unusual and might prove a source of dissatisfaction in future cases. Possibly
they viewed the appearance of a ribbon on the breast of a merchant seaman
as an encroachment on the rights of their own permanent officials. The awards
were not made; silver medals were substituted, which Captain Forbes and his
officers, learning of the Board's action, did not accept. On a later occasion
the same unsympathetic influence was exercised; the Russian Order of St.
Stanislaus was withdrawn and replaced by a gold watch and chain!</p>

<p>In supervision of our qualifications as masters and mates, the Board of Trade
has followed the lines of least resistance. It is true that they have established
certain standards in navigation and seamanship that we must attain in order
to hold certificates, but the training to these standards has never been an interest
of their Department. While our shipmate, the marine engineer, has opportunity
in his apprenticeship on shore to complete his education, we are debarred
from the same facility. Apprenticed to the sea at from fourteen to sixteen
years of age, our youth bid good-bye to their school books and enter on a life
of freedom from scholarly restraint&mdash;a 'kindergarten' in which their toys
are hand-implements of the sea. There is no need to worry; there is no study
required for four years; a week or two at the crammer's will suffice to satisfy
the Board of Trade when apprenticeship days were over. And the fault does
not lie with the 'crammer.' Scholarly and able and competent, as most of
them are, to impart a better and more thorough instruction, the system of
leaving all to the voyage's end offers to them no alternative but to present the
candidate for examination as rapidly as possible. Sea-apprentices of late years
did not often share in a scheme of instruction afloat. Rarely were they carried
as complements to a full crew; for the most part they were workmen in a
scant manning&mdash;'greenhorns'&mdash;drudges to the whim of any grown man. In
a rough measure, the standard of such seamanship as they <i>gathered</i> was good&mdash;else
we had been in ill case to-day&mdash;but it was without method or apprehension&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
smattering&mdash;the only saving grace of which lay in the ready resource that
only seafaring engenders. The exactions of a busy working sea-life left little
leisure for self-advancement in study; the short, and ever shortening, intervals
of a stay in port provided small opportunity for exercise of a helping
hand from the shore. By deceptive short cuts that gave small enlightenment,
by rules&mdash;largely mnemonic&mdash;we passed our tests and obtained our certificates.
On shore, the landward youth fared better. The spirit of the times provided
a free and growing opportunity for the study of technics and advance of scientific
craftsmanship. The Navy took full advantage of this tide. The Board of Admiralty
saw the futility of the old system of sea-training, having regard to the
complete alteration of the methods in seamanship and navigation. Naval
education could no longer be compensated by a schedule of bugle-calls and the
exactitude of a hammock-lashing. Concurrent with a sound sea-training,
general education was insisted upon. Zealously Admiralty guided their youth on
a path that led to a culture and appreciation of values, wide in scope, to serve
their profession. If it was essential, in the national interest, that the general
education and sea-training of naval officers should be so closely supervised,
it was surely little less important that that of the merchants' officers should receive
some measure of attention. But for the private efforts of some few shipowners,
nothing on the lines of a considered scheme was done. No assistance or advice
or grant in aid was made by the Board of Trade. While drawing to their coffers
huge sums, accumulations of fines and forfeitures, deserters' wages, fees, the unclaimed
earnings of deceased seamen, they could afford no assistance to guide the
youthful seaman through a course of right instruction to a better sea-knowledge;
they made no advances to place our education on a less haphazard basis. It
may be cited as an evidence of <i>their</i> indifference that a large proportion of unsuccessful
candidates for the junior certificates fail in a test of <i>dictation</i>.</p>

<p>With our entry to the war at sea in 1914, the same indifference was manifest.
There was no mobilization or registration of merchant seamen to aid a scheme
of manning and to control the chaos that was very soon evident. Despite their
intimate knowledge of the gap in our ranks made by the calling-up of the Naval
Reserve&mdash;accentuated by the enlistment of merchant seamen in the Navy&mdash;the
Board of Trade could see no menace to the sea-transport service in the
military recruitment of our men. It was apparently no concern of theirs that
we sailed on our difficult voyages short-handed, or with weak crews of inefficient
landsmen, while so many of our skilled seamen and numbers of our sea-officers
were marking time in the ranks of the infantry. Under pressure of events, it was
not until November 1915 they took a somewhat hesitating step. This was their
proclamation; it may be contrasted with Captain Greenville Collins's preface.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />"MAINTENANCE OF BRITISH SHIPPING</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At the present time the efficient maintenance of our Mercantile Marine
is of vital national interest, and captains, officers, engineers, and their
crews will be doing as good service for their country by continuing to man
British ships as by joining the army.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">The President of the Board of Trade.</span>"<br />
</div></div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">At</span> the present time"! Possibly our Board was writing in anticipation
of the completion of the Channel tunnel, or of a date when our men-at-arms
and their colossal equipment, the food and furnishings of the nation, the material
aid to our Allies, could be transported by air. "As good service"! An
equality! An option! Was it a matter of simple balance that a seaman on
military service was using his hardily acquired sea-experience as wisely as in
the conduct of his own skilled trade, as efficiently as in maintaining the lines of
our oversea communications? Events at this date were proving that we had
no need to go ashore for fighting service.</div>

<p>In the first violence of unrestricted submarine warfare, the Board advanced
little, if any, assistance to the victims of German savagery. Their machinery
existed only to repatriate torpedoed crews under warrant as "distressed British
seamen"; they were content to leave destitution, hunger&mdash;the rags and tatters
of a body covering&mdash;to be relieved and refitted by the charitable efforts of philanthropic
Seamen's Societies. To them&mdash;to the kindly souls who met us at the
tide-mark&mdash;we give all honour and gratitude, but it was surely a shirking of
responsibility on part of our Board that placed the burden of our maintenance
on the committee of a Seaman's Bethel. As a tentative measure, our controllers
advanced a scheme of insurance of effects&mdash;a business proposition, of which
many took advantage. Later, this was altered to a gratuitous compensation.
Cases occurred in which distressed seamen had a claim under both schemes:
their foresight was not accounted to them. Although proof might be forthcoming
of the loss of an outfit that the small compensation could not cover,
they could claim only on one or the other, the insurance or the gratuitous
compensation. It was evident that the Board derived some measure of assistance
from the examiners in bankruptcy on their staff.</p>

<p>In certain seaports&mdash;notably at Southampton&mdash;Sailors' Homes (built and
endowed for the comfort and accommodation of the merchant seamen) were
permitted, without protest, to be requisitioned by Admiralty for the sole use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of their naval ratings. The merchantmen, on service of equal importance
and equal danger, were turned out to the streets, and our Board took no action,
registered no complaint.</p>

<p>To await popular clamour was evidently a guiding principle with our controllers.
Their view was probably that we were private employees in trading
ventures, that their concern was only to see the sea-law carried out. Sea-law,
however, was not in question in the case of the master and officers of <i>Augustine</i>,
and, if they could assume the right to interfere in that personal matter, they
accepted a position as curators of the personnel of the Merchants' Service. They
cannot complain if our understanding of their duties does not agree with theirs.
Deliberately, they have asserted that our sea-conduct is within their province.</p>

<p>An extraordinary matter is the character and calibre of the Board's marine
officials. Unquestionably able and personally sympathetic as they are, it
remains the more incomprehensible that our governance is so stupidly controlled.
Perhaps their submissions fail of acceptance in the councils of a higher control&mdash;that
has also to decide on horse-racing and bankruptcy. Under a less heavily
encumbered Ministry, our affairs should receive the consideration that is their
due. It required but little experience of the new sea-warfare to establish our
claim to be considered a national service with a mission and employment no
less vital and combatant than that of the enlisted arms. Master and man, we
have earned the right to no small voice in the control of our own affairs. Our
sea-interests are large enough to require a separate Department of the State, a
Ministry of Marine, in which we should have a part.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade has failed us, they have proved unworthy of our confidence.
Quite lately they began to mobilize and register the mercantile seamen
of the country. <i>Three years and nine months after the outbreak of war, they sounded
the 'assembly' of the Merchants' Service.</i> Let that be their epitaph!</p>

<h3>MANNING</h3>


<div class='cap'>SEA-LABOUR cannot be likened to employment on shore. Once signed and
boarded and to sea, there can be no dismissal and replacement of the men
such as may be seen any morning at the street gates of a workshop or
shipyard. Good or bad, we are bound as shipmates for a voyage. Ordinary
laws and regulations cannot reach us in our sailing; we are given the Merchant
Shipping Act for our guidance, the longest and wordiest Act on the Statute
Book, a measure that presupposes a discipline that no longer exists. Our ships,
in size and power&mdash;our complement, in number and character&mdash;have altered
greatly beyond the views of the Act. That statute, that in its day may have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sufficed to set a standard of law and order to the moderate crews of our sailing
ships, is utterly inadequate to control effectively the large ship's company of
our modern steam vessels. The men, too, are changed&mdash;the sailormen, perhaps,
not greatly&mdash;but, with the thundering evolution of steam-power, we have drawn
grown men to the fires, ready-made men, uninfluenced by traditions of sea-service.
We had no hand in their making&mdash;in the early years when discipline may be
inculcated and character be formed. The drudgery and uninterest of their heavy
work makes for a certain reaction that frequently finds its expression in violence
and criminal disorder. The short voyage system and the grossly inadequate
provisions of the Act afford no opportunity to guide the reaction in a less vicious
direction. We hailed as a benefactor to the sea the inventor of single topsails;
the statistics of our sea-fatalities give a definite date to their introduction. Daily
we pray for an inventor to emancipate our stokehold gangs.</div>

<p>It would be idle to pretend that, as master-seamen, we were not disquieted
by our manning problem, following upon the outbreak of war. While mobilization
of the Army Reserve drew men from all industries in a proportion that
did not affect seriously any one employment, the calling-up of the Royal Naval
Reserve strained our resources in men to the utmost. Seamen, naval or mercantile,
are of one great trade: the balance of our activities being thrown
suddenly and violently to one side of our engagement could not fail in disorganizing
the other. Added to the outgoing of the retained Reserve seamen, recruitment
of a new Reserve to man Auxiliaries and Special Service vessels was almost
instantly begun. There were many applicants; the choice naturally fell
upon our best men remaining. In and after August 1914, we were short-handed
in the Merchants' Service. We were, indeed more than short-handed,
for the loss of our steadiest men had effect in removing a certain check
upon indiscipline. We missed just that influence upon which, for want of
adequate authoritative powers, we counted to preserve some measure of
subordinance in our ranks.</p>

<p>Large vessels were most seriously affected. The service of troop transport
suffered and was delayed. On occasion, there was the amazing instance of
some 1500 trained and disciplined troops standing by to await the sobering-up
and return to duty of a body of seamen and firemen. Drunkenness is not yet
accounted a crime, but the holding up of vital reinforcements was no petty fault.
Under the Act we were empowered to inflict a fine of exactly five shillings on
each offender. The offence that held 1500 soldiers in check was met by a mulct
of two half-crowns.</p>

<span class="caption">LIVERPOOL: MERCHANTMEN SIGNING ON FOR OVERSEA VOYAGES</span>
</div>

<p>The Army and the Naval Authorities were startled, as at a situation they had
not contemplated. Masters and officers, if not actually challenged, were deemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to be responsible for such a state of insubordination among their crews. While
such an assumption was, to a degree, unjust, it is true that we were not wholly
blameless. For the sake of a quiet commercial life, we had accepted the difficulties
of our manning without protest. In this we erred. Had we been an
independent and economically fearless body, we would, in the days before the
war, have refused to proceed to sea with any less than the summary powers
held by a magistrate on shore to enforce law and order in his district. It is
true that no magisterial powers will prevent drunkenness, but that condition
on the ships was due directly to the general indiscipline that we were unable
wholly to control.</p>

<p>The state of affairs called for more than a merely temporary measure, but our
controllers advanced no settlement&mdash;only they devised an expedient. The
situation was met, not by a firm action that would affect all merchant ships and
seamen alike, but by a Defence of the Realm regulation that operated only when
ships were chartered directly by Government. The opportunity to make the
merchantmen's forecastle a place for decent men to earn a living was passed
by. While admitting, by their concern, that the matter called for redress,
Government could only take action in cases where their bureaucratic interests
were threatened. Vessels on purely commercial voyages, including carriage
of the mails and millions in the nation's securities, were left without the regulation:
we had to carry on as best we could. It entailed hardship on the better-disposed
members of our ships' companies: in whatever fashion, the work had
to be carried on: we taxed our steady men to the limit. The effect upon them
may be judged when they realized that the delinquency of their shipmates,
whose duty they had undertaken, was assessed at the price of a pound of 'Fair
Maid' tobacco.</p>

<p>While the quality of our men was thus affected, we suffered in their diminished
numbers. Without a protest from our governing body, the Board of Trade,
the army took a toll of our seamen. Thus early, it was not realized that we
merchantmen would have to fight for our ships and our lives at sea. The drums
of field-war set up a note that was heard outside of six fathoms of blue water;
large numbers of our seamen and many ships' officers joined up for military service.
There was a certain measure of compensation afforded by the industrial
situation ashore. As the magnitude of the world conflict was realized, nervous
employers of labour reduced their staffs. All workmen suffered, the building
trades being perhaps most affected. As needs must, we were open to recruit
able-bodied men: we had to make seamen, and that quickly. Masons, brick-layers,
tilers, slaters&mdash;they reached tide-mark in their quest for employment.
We were glad enough to sign them on to make up our complements. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
first they were not of great value. Unused to the sea and ship-life, they had to
be nursed through stormy weather: a source of anxiety to the watch-keeper
when the seas were up. In time they became moderately efficient. As good
tradesmen, they had a self-respect that could be encouraged: they were not
difficult to control.</p>

<p>Of these, perhaps 50 per cent. made a second voyage, but not more than
10 per cent. remained at sea permanently. Their reasons for returning to the
beach were always the same. Not the hard work or the seas appalled them,
but the class of men with whom they had to live and work. Some of our recruits
had other objects in view than a desire for a sea-life. At ports abroad, notably
in the United States, they deserted. Strict as the Federal machinery is for
regulating immigration into the United States, there appeared to be no keen
desire on the part of the authorities to embarrass the improper entry of our men.
It was not difficult to assign a cause for their laxity. Technically, the men were
seamen. Our Uncle Sam was stirring towards true sea-power&mdash;the acquisition
of large mercantile fleets. The native American could see no prosperous commercial
career in the forecastle: only from abroad might labour be obtained
for operation of the ships. We had done the same in our time. Desertions
were not confined to the landsmen of our crews. A situation arose quickly,
in which it became profitable for our men to desert abroad and re-sign on another
ship at an enhanced pay. As though to facilitate their breach of agreement, it
was not long before the United States Seamen's Act came into force. By
some international process that we seamen are not yet able to understand,
this Act became operative on every vessel entering an American port. It establishes,
for all seamen, the 'right to quit.' Strangely, our men did not all
abandon ship. Some stirring of the patriotism that, later, became pronounced
among them must have had effect in restraining wholesale disembarkation.
Short-handed by perhaps an eighth of a full crew, we made our return voyages.
By shift and expedient, we kept a modest head of steam. The loss was almost
wholly at the fires. Stewards were set to deck duties and the look-out, the
released sailormen went below to the stokehold&mdash;on occasion, passengers were
recruited on board to bear a hand. Perhaps the public grumbled at receiving
their letters an hour or two behind time.</p>

<p>It is not easy to advance reasons for the new and better spirit that came to us
coincident with the appearance of German savagery at sea. Restrictions of
the supply of drink had effect in enabling us to commence a voyage under good
conditions, without brawling and bloodshed in the forecastle. An atmosphere
of determination was, perhaps, introduced by the tales of undying heroism
in the trenches that reached us. The losses in ships served partially to supplement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the numbers of men available: a choice could be made in engagement of a
crew. Over all, there was the menace to our seafaring&mdash;the threat and challenge
to our sea-pride, as compelling and remedial as the draught of a free breeze.
In his action, the enemy made many miscalculations; not the least was when he
roused a spirit of readiness to service in our merchantmen; he blew more than
the acrid fumes into us with the shattering explosion of his torpedoes.</p>

<p>If we may claim a patriotic influence acting upon our white seamen as reason
for good service in the war, how shall we assess the lascar's quiet employment
in a conflict that, perhaps, only dimly he understood? Of its operation he could
have no ignorance. <i>Schrecklichkeit</i> was particularly to be employed against the
native seaman. Shell and torpedo took toll of his numbers, but there was little
hesitancy when he was invited to sign for further voyages. It was ever a point
of prophecy with his detractors in the days of peace that he would be found
wanting under stress. Not boldly or magnificently or in a spirit of vainglory,
but in a manner that is not the less impressive because few have spoken of it,
he has given them the lie.</p>

<p>The attitude of the naval authorities in regard to our manning is peculiar.
They seem to be unable to think of ships' crews in any other terms than that
of their own large complements. There is one part in the lectures of our instructional
course that never fails to arouse rude merriment among the master-seamen
attending&mdash;as it produces a shamefaced attitude on part of the naval
lecturer (now intimate with our difficulties). In instructions for detailing our
men to 'action stations' the phrases occur: "a party to be detached for attention
to wounded," "a party to serve hoses at fire stations," "an ammunition
supply party," "party to put the provisions and blankets in the boats." In
practice, we are also working the guns, attending the navigation, spotting the
fall of shot, keeping post at wheel and look-out. The average cargo vessel
rarely carries more than eight men on deck: we cannot afford to have many
wounded!</p>

<h3>THE COASTAL SERVICES</h3>


<h3><br />THE HOME TRADE</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
"<i>We're a North-country ship, an' a deep-water crew.</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;"><i>A&mdash;way, i-oh!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;"><i>Ye can stick t' th' coast, but we're damned if we do.</i></span><br />

<br /></div>


<div class='cap'>SO we sang&mdash;sounding a bravery at the capstan as we hove around and raised
anchor to begin a voyage. We had our ideas. We were foreign-going
sailors, putting out on a far venture. In pride of our seafaring&mdash;of
rounding the Horn, of crossing Equator, perhaps of a circumnavigation&mdash;we
looked down upon the coaster. He was a hoveller, a tidesman, a mud-raker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&mdash;his
anchors could shew no coral on the flukes as they came awash. We carried
these ideas to the beach. Deliberately, we produced an atmosphere that is unjust
to the cross-channel man.</div>

<p>The oversea voyage possesses a greater appeal to the imagination. Long
distances, variation of the climes, storm and high ocean seas&mdash;a burthen of
goods brought from a far country, all contribute to make an impression that the
tale of a coasting <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'vayage'">voyage</ins> could not produce. Familiarity, perhaps, has robbed
the short-carriers' sea-trip of what shreds of romance existed. In tide and out,
the smaller vessels have grown to the sight as almost part of the familiar quays
and wharves they frequent. A voyage from Tyne to the Thames or from Glasgow
to Liverpool is so common and everyday that little remark is excited. We
are unconcerned at its incident; the gale that wrecked a collier on the Black
Middens may have blown a tile or two from our roof; the fog that bound the
Antwerp boat for a tide is, perhaps, the same that held us in the City for an hour
over time. We may entertain our friends with recital of a sea-voyage, but we
have not a great deal to say of a Channel passage.</p>

<p>At war, this focus of the public outlook has persisted. The threat to our
sea-communications, to the source by which the nation gains its daily bread,
has drawn an intense interest to the fortunes of the ships, but that interest has
rarely been extended to the coasting vessels and the seamen who man them;
there is little said of the work of the coastal pilots, on whose skill and local knowledge
so much depends. We are concerned for our <i>Britannics</i> and <i>Justitias</i>,
but the fate of the <i>Sarah Pritchard</i> of Beaumaris, or the escape of <i>Boy Jacob</i> are
small events in relation to the toll of our tonnage. Their utility has not been
brought before us in the same way as the direct service of the great ocean carriers.
It is not difficult to understand that a breakdown of that source of supply would
mean starvation and disaster. Our dependence on the coasting vessels is not
so apparent. The vital needs served by them are, in part, obscured. We are,
perhaps, satisfied that alternative channels exist for passage of the tonnage
they transport: road and rail are open for inland carriage.</p>

<p>The situation is not quite so clear. Pressure at the rail-heads, at the collieries,
at the steelworks and the manufactories, has thrown a burden on our island
railways that they are unable to bear. But for the service of the coasters and the
resolution of the home-trade seamen, the block to our traffic could not have
been other than fatal. By relieving the congestion on the lines, they made
possible the expansion of our output of munitions. Millions of tons that would
otherwise have been put upon land transport (and have lain to swell the accumulations),
are brought to tide-mark to be handled and cleared and ferried between
home ports and across the channels by the coasting vessels. The Fleet is coaled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and stored almost entirely by sea. Our men in France and Flanders are carried
and fed and refitted by light-draught steamers. Power is transmitted to our Allies
from British coalfields by our grimy colliers. Constant voyaging, dispatch at
the ports of lading and discharge, seagoing through all weathers, make huge the
total of their tonnage, but their individual cargoes rank small against the mammoth
burdens of the oversea merchantmen. The sea-ants (however busily they
throng the ports) are seldom remarked; their work is carried on in the shadow of
more spectacular and lengthy voyaging. On occasion, a stray beam of popular
recognition is turned on the smaller craft&mdash;as when <i>Wandle</i> steams up Thames
after her gallant fight, or when <i>Thordis</i> (Bell, master) rams and sinks a U-boat&mdash;but
the light is quickly slewed again to illuminate the seafaring of the oversea
vessels. Similarly&mdash;with the men&mdash;interest has centred on the deep-water
mariner; the coasting masters and their crews, together with the pilots, are
little heard of. Their navigations, steering by the land on a short passage of a
tide or two, have not the compelling emphasis of long voyaging on distant seas.
Chroniclers of our deeds and fates have set out the drawn agony of the raft and
the open boat in mid-Atlantic; they are less insistent on the tragedies (as bitter
and prolonged) of inshore waters. Perhaps they are influenced by a common
misconception that succour is ever ready at hand in the narrow sea. There
are the lifeboats on the coast, patrols on keen look-out in the channels, vessels
are ever passing up and down the fairways; the land, in any case, is not far
distant. Such assurance has but slender warrant. Gallant, unselfish, and
thorough as are the services of the lifeboatmen, their operations in the main are
intended to serve known wrecks and strandings. A flare in the darkness or
a flash of gunfire in the channels is now no special signal; the new sea-casualty
gives little time or warning for a muster of resources. The ready succour of the
patrols is, perhaps, more instant and alert, but the channel seaways cover an area
that no system could place under a quartered post or guard. No vigilance
could prevent the capture of <i>Brussels</i> and the martyrdom of Captain Fryatt;
the crew of the <i>Nelson</i> smack were for over thirty hours adrift in the narrow seas
ere they were sighted and rescued. In the busy waters of the Irish Sea, three men
of the ketch <i>Lady of the Lake</i> made ten miles in eight hours under oars, after their
vessel had been sunk by gunfire. A weary progress, with ships passing near and
far, but none daring too close the boat that might, for all they know, be trap for
an enemy mine or torpedo.</p>

<p>It is time we ceased to sing that Rio Grande chanty: an <i>amende</i> is overdue.</p>

<p>While we, the foreign-going men, have our 'ins and outs' of the most dangerous
seas&mdash;serving our turn in the front-line sea-trenches, then retiring to a rest in
safer and more distant waters&mdash;the coastal seaman has no such relief. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
daily duty lies in the storm-centre, in the very midst of the sea-war. From
harbour mouth to the booms of his port of entry, no course can be steered
that does not drive his keel through minable areas and across the ranges of
lurking submarines.</p>

<p>The new sea-warfare has developed a scheme of offence that renders our inshore
waters peculiarly fraught with peril to navigators. The coast-line is no longer
a defence and protection; rather, by limiting sea-room in man&oelig;uvre, the shoals
and rock-bound beach have turned ally to the enemy. Sea-mark and headland
provide a guide in estimating the run of a torpedo; note of a point definite,
on which sea-routes converge, is of value to a submarine commander. Even
in the shallower waters&mdash;depths in which a torpedo attack would be difficult&mdash;an
equally deadly offence may be maintained. The run of the sea-bottom in
the channels offering a good hold to slipped mine-moorings, it was not long before
the enemy had adapted submarines to continue the minelaying that our command
of the surface had stopped. While new and larger U-boats are sent abroad on
the trade routes, special submarines, less encumbered by the stores and equipment
that longer passages would demand, make frequent visits to the fairways to
sow a freight of mines. No section of the channels holds sanctuary for the coaster.
Close inshore, as in the offing, is all a danger area, open to the stealthy visits of
the submarine minelayers. Right on the Mersey Bar, the Liverpool pilot
steamer went up with a loss of forty lives; remote West Highland bays have
echoed to the crash of mines exploded; seaward of the Irish banks, the deeps
are alike dangerous. Counter-measures there are (services as efficient and
resourceful in life-saving as those of the enemy are cunning and viciously ingenious
in murder), but even the gallantry and skill and untiring efforts of our
minesweepers cannot wholly clear the immense water-spaces. Mechanical
contrivances&mdash;the Otters&mdash;are valuable, and aid in fending the mines, but (the
sea-bottom being foul with wreckage) they are often a danger to their carriers.
There is ever the harassing uncertainty which no vigilance may allay. The
sheer relief of passing over the hundred-fathom line to the comparative safety
of the deeps of ocean is never experienced by the cross-channel captain.</p>

<p>Favoured by their light draught and smaller proportions, the coasters are
perhaps less exposed to successful torpedo attack than their larger and deeper
ocean sisters. In the early days of submarine activity, the enemy was loath
to use his deadlier and more expensive weapon on the small craft. He relied on
gunfire to produce effects. The channel seas were not then as well patrolled as
now by armed auxiliaries: he could have a leisurely exercise in frightfulness at
little risk to himself&mdash;there was no return to his fire&mdash;it was an easy target practice.
<i>Cottingham</i> was shelled at short ranges when off the Bristol Channel. Unarmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and outdistanced, the master stopped his engines, lowered the two boats, and
abandoned ship. The shelling continued, but was directed on the sinking ship;
the submarine commander evidently thought the bitter wintry weather would
accomplish a more refined <i>Schrecklichkeit</i> than the summary execution of his shell-bursts.
In the heavy battery of a sou'west gale, the boats drove apart. The
master's boat was sighted by a patrol, and the crew of six rescued after some hours'
exposure. The mate's boat came ashore at Portliskey in Wales, bottom up and
shattered; of the seven men who had manned her there was no trace. Six of
<i>Cottingham's</i> crew survived the bitter weather&mdash;six hardy seamen were spared
to return to service afloat. The German became dissatisfied with a frightfulness
that murdered only half a merchant ship's crew when it was possible to murder
all. It was not enough to destroy the ships and leave the seamen to the wind and
sea and bitter weather. If they were not to be driven from their calling by fear,
there were other measures&mdash;sure, definite, final. There was to be no weakness
among the apostles of the new creed, no shrinking, no humanity&mdash;British seamen
were to follow their shattered ships to the litter of the channel bottom. The
<i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i> set forth that "in future, our German submarines and aircraft
would wage war against British mercantile vessels without troubling themselves in
any way about the fate of the crews." The <i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i> could not have been
well informed. Their submarine commanders troubled themselves greatly about
the fate of our crews. They shelled the boats in many subsequent attacks. They
expended ammunition in efforts to secure that no further seafaring would be
possible to their victims. Sheer individual murder took the place of an illegal
act of war. ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We were unarmed, a slow ship. The submarine hit us with a
shot on the bow and then ran up the signal to take to the lifeboats. We did
so, and several shots were fired at the <i>Palermo</i>. They did not take effect, however,
and a torpedo was sent into her side. She sank within a few minutes.
Whether the fact that he had to use a torpedo to send our vessel to the bottom
angered the commander I do not know, but the submarine came directly alongside
of our lifeboats. The commander was on the deck, and yelled, 'Where is the
captain of that ship?' The captain stood up and made his way to the side where
the German was standing. The German held his revolver close to our captain's
head. 'You will never bring <i>another ship across this ocean</i>,' he said, using several
oaths, then he pulled the trigger. Our captain fell dead, and we were permitted
to continue."</p>

<p>The new campaign was directed particularly against the coasters and fishermen.
The procedure was simple. No great speed or gun-range was required.
There was no risk, if a good look-out was kept for patrols and war craft. The
helpless, unarmed vessel, outsped and hulled, was brought-to within easy range,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and shelling could be continued to augment the confusion of boat-lowering in
a seaway. If by resolution and fine seamanship the boats were got away,
there was further target practice with shrapnel or machine-gun. The schooner
<i>Jane Williamson</i> of Arklow was attacked without warning. The first shot
smashed one of her boats, the second killed one of the crew. At shouting distance&mdash;a
hundred yards range&mdash;point-blank under the submarine's gun&mdash;there could
be no question of defence or escape. The remaining five hands put over the
second boat, tumbled into her and shoved clear. To hit the boat the submarine's
gun must have been slewed deliberately from the larger target: bad shooting
could not have occurred. Afloat and helpless, a shell struck her, killing one man
outright, mortally wounding the master and another, and damaging the frail
row-boat. The Germans beckoned the boat to them, but it was only to laugh
at the throes of the dying men. The U-boat submerged, leaving the three survivors
to ship oars and face the long weary pull towards the distant land. The
<i>William</i> was sunk by gunfire; the gun's crew of the U-boat then loaded shrapnel
and turned the gun on the open boat, wounding a man of the crew. <i>Redcap</i> was
hauling her trawl when without any warning shrapnel burst on board. There was
no challenge, the fishermen had made no attempt to get under way and escape.
Busied with the gear, all hands were grouped together, when the shell exploded
among them. One hand was killed instantly, the mate's leg was blown off, two
seamen were wounded. Under fire, the survivors put the boat over and removed
the wounded; the Germans gave no thought to their distress, but centred rapid
fire on the trawler, sunk her, and disappeared.</p>

<span class="caption">A HEAVILY ARMED COASTING BARGE</span>
</div>

<p>When guns were served to merchant ships, the coasters shared in their issue.
Encounters with enemy submarines were no longer one-sided and hopeless.
Effects could not be secured by the Germans at so small a cost. Frequently
the effects were those that the submarine commander was most anxious to
avoid. <i>Atalanta</i> picked up the crew of <i>Mar&eacute;chal de Villars</i>, then fought
off the U-boat that had sunk that vessel. Watchers on the coastal headlands
saw many a running fight between handy little home-traders and the
under-sea pirates. Nor were the fishermen slow in action. Once armed for
defence, they proved that they could use their weapons with skill and precision.
Off Aberdeen in stormy weather, a German submarine hove up from
his depths for practice on a fleet of trawlers. It was to be a <i>Redcap</i> diversion:
rapid fire, shrapnel, boats thrown out hastily, common shell on the hulls of the
trawlers&mdash;wholesale destruction. But there was a mistake. A 'watch-dog' was
among the fleet&mdash;<i>Commissioner</i>, armed and alert. At an opportune moment
she cut her gear adrift, canted under speed and helm, returned the U-boat's
fire and sank her in five rounds. Submarine commanders soon realized that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
'diversions' were risky, the target could now hit back. It was safer to submerge
when within range of anything larger than a row-boat. Even the sailing barges
acquired a sting. In proportion to her tonnage, <i>Drei Geschwister</i>&mdash;a captured
German, refitted to our coastal service&mdash;is probably the heaviest armed vessel
afloat.</p>

<p>In channel waters, look-outs must not be confined to the round of the sea.
To the U-boat's gunfire and torpedo, to the menace of moored and drifting
mines, is added a danger that rarely threatens the oversea trader&mdash;an attack
from the air. Striking distance from enemy bases has given opportunity
for exercise of aircraft. Zeppelin and seaplane have their turns of activity
in the North Sea and the Straits. Steering a careful course in a sea 'foul
with floating mines,' the Cork steamship <i>Avocet</i> was attacked by three aeroplanes.
The action lasted for over half an hour. Bombs exploded alongside,
the bridge and upper decks were scarred and pitted by a hail of machine-gun
bullets. The master and mate kept the aircraft at a respectful height by
using their rifles&mdash;the only arms carried. By skilful handling, Captain Brennell
saved his ship. He is probably the only seaman who has steered a deliberate
course between a 'fall' of bombs; swinging on starboard helm, 'three bombs
missed the starboard bow and three the port quarter by at most seven feet.'
The <i>Birchgrove</i> was attacked by two seaplanes carrying torpedoes&mdash;a novel
adaptation. Again the use of ready helm proved a moving ship a difficult
target. Both torpedoes missed. Less fortunate was the <i>Franz Fischer</i>, an ex-German
collier. Anchored off the Kentish Knock, the night black dark, the
thunder of a Zeppelin's engines was heard overhead. Before there was time to
extinguish all lights, the huge airship was able to take up a position for attack.
One heavy bomb sufficed. <i>Franz Fischer</i> reeled to a tremendous explosion,
heeled over, and sank. Only three survived of her crew of sixteen.</p>

<p>Constant sea-perils are enhanced by war measures in the channels. On
open sea there is less confusion; the issue is narrowed to contest between ship
and submarine and the hazard of a derelict or floating mine&mdash;there is ample sea-room
in which to 'back and fill.' The coaster has a harder task. His navigational
problem is complicated by the eight hundred odd pages of 'Notices to
Mariners'&mdash;the amends and addends and cancellations of Admiralty instructions
relating to the seafaring of the coast. Inner channels are confused by 'friendly'
minefields or by alteration of the buoyage; aids to navigation are suspended or
rearranged on scant notice; coastwise lights are put out or have their powers
reduced to small efficiency in the mists and grey weather. Unmarked wrecks,
growing daily in numbers, litter the sea-bottom; areas are to be avoided to leave
a fair field for the hunters; zigzag courses in close proximity to the land sustain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a constant anxiety. Above all, navigation without lights increases the danger
to all merchantmen and to the patrols and naval craft that crowd the seaways of
the coast.</p>

<p>Through all that the enemy can set against them, the home-trade vessels
proceed on their voyages. Their losses are heavy in numbers (if the sum of their
tonnage be not great), but the press of short sea-carriers that passes <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'upChannel'">up Channel</ins> or
down shews no evidence that frightfulness achieves an effect in holding them,
loath, at their moorings. There is freight enough for all. Every vessel that
has a sound keel and a helm to steer her is actively employed. Old craft and odd
are come on the sea to serve turn in our emergency. Barges and inland watermen,
Hudson Bay sloops, whilom pleasure craft, mud-hoppers reshelled, hulks even,
are used; if they can neither sail nor steam, the ropemakers can supply a hawser&mdash;there
is trade and bargain for a tow. After peace-years of grinding competition
with the freight-grabbing steam coasters, the sailing craft of the smaller ports
have found a new prosperity, from which no risks can daunt them. Sailmakers
and rigging-cutters, the block and spar makers, have taken up their old tools
again, and the gallant little topsail schooners, brigantines, cutters, and ketches
are out under canvas.</p>

<p>The German boast that he can achieve victory by submarine policy could be
nowhere more plainly refuted than in the War Channel that extends from the
Thames to the Tyne. The evidence is there for all to judge. The seaway is
foul with wrecks, foundered on beach and sandbar&mdash;the tide vexed by under-water
obstructions. Topmast spars with whitened cordage whipping in the wind
stand out above the swirl of the tides; a shattered bow-section or gaunt listed
shell of a wrecked vessel sets the turn to a new shoal drift; crazy funnels, twisted
and arake by the broken hulls below, stud the angles of the buoyage that marks
the fairway. Disaster to our shipping is plainly shewn, grouped in a way that
no figures or statistics could rival. But there is other evidence. Daybreak
in the Channel gives light to a progress of seaworthy craft that seems in no way
diminished by the worst that the enemy can do. He has failed, despite the sinister
sea-marks that litter the fairway. Down the river estuaries and out from the sea-harbour
and roadstead, the coasters still join in company through the channels.
An unending procession; the grey seascape is never free of their whirling smoke-wreaths.
Passing and turning in the deeps, they steam close to the red-rusted,
shattered hulls of their sister ships. The gaunt masses of tortured steel stand
out as monuments to an indomitable spirit&mdash;or to an influence that calls their
sea-mates out to steer by the loom of their wreckage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />PILOTS</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">If</span> we may count antiquity and precedence a claim, the pilot is the real senior
of our trade. Before the ship and her tackling&mdash;the rude coracle, setting across
the river bars or steering on a short passage by sea-marks on the coast,
before the oversea venturer with his guide in sun and star&mdash;the lodesman, who
marked the deeps and the shallows.</div>

<p>The pilot's departure and boarding are definite and well-marked incidents
in the course of a voyage, and have a significance and interest few other ship-happenings
claim. He is our last and first connection with the shore. His
leaving is attended by a sober emotion, a compound of regret and impatience;
regret that his sure support is withdrawn&mdash;impatience to go ahead to open
sea. He backs over the rail and lurches down the swaying side-ladder to his
dinghy to an accompaniment of cordial good-byes. Passengers crowd the
bulwarks to watch his small boat go a-bobbing in the stern-wash as we gather
way. It hardly occurs to them that their farewell letters, now in his weather-stained
bag, may be for days or weeks unposted; to them he is the last post&mdash;the
link is snapped, the voyage now really begun.</p>

<p>There may be masters who affect a fine aloofness when the pilot boards them
on incoming, others who preserve a detached air&mdash;but there are few who do not
feel relief in answering the cheerful hail&mdash;'All well aboard, Captain?'&mdash;as the
pilot puts a cautious testing foot on the side-ladder. Here is the voyage practically
at an end with the coming of an expert in local navigation. The anxiety
of a landfall is over. The channel buoys, port hand and starboard, stretch
out ahead to mark definite limits to shoal and sandbank; familiar landmarks
loom up through the drift of distant city haze; the outer lightship curtsies
in the swell, beckoning us into port to resume the brief round of longshore life.
After a lengthy period of silence and detachment, we are again in touch with the
affairs of the beach; the news of the day and of weeks past is told to us in intervals
of steering orders&mdash;sailor news, edited by a competent understanding of our professional
interests. The tension of the voyage is unconsciously relaxed. We are
in good hands. The engines turn steadily and we come in from sea.</p>

<p>If the pilot was ever a welcome attendant in the peaceful days, his services in
the war earn for him an even warmer appreciation. War measures in their operation
have rendered our seaports difficult of entry. The buoyage has, perhaps,
been reset in the interval of a voyage's absence. Boom defences and examination
areas exist, channels are closed or obstructed; certain of the lightships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
or floating marks may be withdrawn on short warning. Amid all our doubts
and uncertainties, we look for the one assured sea-mark on the unfamiliar
bars&mdash;the red-and-white emblem of a pilot vessel on her boarding station. Undeterred
by the risk of mine or torpedo while marking time on their cruising
ground, the pilots are constantly on the alert to board the incoming vessels as
they approach from seaward. No state of the weather drives the cutter from
her station to seek shelter in safer waters. If the seas are too high for boatwork,
she steams ahead and offers a lead to a quieter section of the fairway where
boarding may be attempted.</p>

<p>Turn and turn of the pilots in service can no longer be effected. The even
balances of their roster (that worked so well in peace-time) have been rudely
disturbed by war. The steady round of duty, in which every man knew
the date of his relief, has given place to a state of 'feast and famine'; all
hands are frequently mustered to meet the sudden and unheralded demands
of an inward-bound convoy, or the limited accommodation of the cutter is taxed
and overloaded by the release of pilots from an outward mass sailing.</p>

<p>There are grades of pilotage&mdash;from that of the rivers and protected waters
to the more hazardous voyages between coastal ports. It is, perhaps, to the sea-pilots
of Trinity we are most intimately drawn. While the river pilot is with us
for the short term of the tide, the Trinity man is of our ship's company for a day
or days. His valued local knowledge is at our service to set and steer fair courses
in the perplexing tangents of unfamiliar tideways; operations of the minesweepers
and patrols&mdash;that alter and multiply beyond counting in the course of a voyage
abroad&mdash;are a plain book to him. If we meet disaster in the channels, we have
a prompter at our elbow to advise a favourable beaching. We have a peer to
confide in throughout our difficulties. After days of anxious watchkeeping on
the bridge we are well served by a competent relief.</p>

<p>Ship movements in the western waters are controlled by the naval authorities
in a manner that allows of independent sailings, but the Trinity pilots' duties lie
in the Channel and the North Sea, where a more exacting regime is in force.
From the Downs to the north, measures adopted for protection of the ships call
for a time-table of sailings and arrivals that can only be adhered to by the pilot's
aid. A 'War Channel' is established, a sea-lane of some two hundred and
eighty miles that has constantly to be swept and cleared in advance of the
traffic. Navigation in the channel obstructs an efficient search for mines; sweeping
operations interfere with the passage of the ships. No small amount of control
and management is necessary to reconcile conflicting actions and expedite the
safe conduct of the shipping. Latterly, sailings were restricted to the hours of
daylight; a system of sectional passages is enforced, by which all vessels are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
scheduled to make a protected anchorage before nightfall. An effect of this is
to group the vessels in large scattered convoys, forming a pageant of shipping
that even the busiest days of peace-time could not rival.</p>

<p>In all the story of the Downs, the great roadstead can rarely have presented
such a scene as when, on a chill winter morning, we lay at anchor awaiting
passage. Overnight, we had come in under convoy from the westward, eighteen
large ships, to swell the tonnage that had gathered from the Channel ports.
From Kingsdown to the Gull, there was hardly water-space to turn a wherry.
Even in the doubtful holding ground of Trinity Bay some large ships were
anchored, and the fairway through the Roads was encroached upon by more
than one of us&mdash;despite the summary signals from the Guardship. All types were
represented in our assembly; we boasted a combination in dazzle paint to set
us out, and our signal flags carried colour to the mastheads to complete the
variegations of our camouflage. Troop transports from the States, standard
cargo ships, munition carriers come over in the night from the French ports,
high-sided empty colliers returning to the north for further loads, deep-laden
freighters for London, ammunition and store ships for the Fleet, coasters and
barges, made up the mercantile shipping riding at anchor, while naval patrols
and harbour craft under way gave movement to the spectacle. Snow had fallen,
and the uplands above Deal and Walmer had white drifts in the quartered fields.
To seaward, we could see twin wreaths of smoke blowing low on the water,
marking the progress of a flotilla of minesweepers, on whose operations we waited.
A brisk north wind held out our signal flags, shewing our ports of destination,
and the pilot cutter, busily serving men on the inward bound, took note of our
demands. In time, the punt delivered our pilot, and we hove short, awaiting
a signal from the Guardship that would release the traffic.</p>

<p>The teeth of the Goodwins had bared to a snarl of broken water that shewed
the young flood making when movement began among the ships. Long experience
had accustomed the pilots to the ways of the minesweepers, and when the
clearing signal 'Vessels may proceed' was hoisted at the yard-arm of the Guardship,
there were few anchors still to be raised. Crowding out towards the northern
gateway, we found ourselves in close formation. Variations of speeds rendered
the apparent confusion difficult to steer through, but the action of a kindred
masonry among the pilots seemed to clear the narrow sea-lane. There was little
easing of speed; with only a few hours of winter daylight to work in, shipping
was being driven at its utmost power to make the most of the precious time.
'All out,' stoking up and setting a stiff smoke-screen over the seascape, we thinned
out to a more comfortable formation, while the smaller craft, taking advantage
of the rising tide, cut the inner angles of the channel to keep apace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>With flood tide to help us, we made good progress. The press of shipping
gradually dropped astern till only the troop transport, our sea-neighbours of
the convoy, kept company with us. Satisfied with the speed made, the pilot
reckoned up the mileage and the tide. We were for Hull and, with luck, he expected
to make Yarmouth Roads before darkness and the Admiralty regulations
obliged us to bring up. Like all who serve the tide, he was prepared for an upset
to his plans. "Not much use figuring things out in these days, Capt'n," he said.
"A lot o' happenings come our way. In spite o' these fellows out there"&mdash;he
pointed to a group of destroyers lining out on our seaward beam&mdash;"the U-boat
minelayers get in on the channels to lay 'eggs'; as fast as we can sweep them
up, sometimes. But"&mdash;cheerfully&mdash;"they don't always get back for another
load: saw the bits o' one being towed into Harwich last week."</p>

<p>Happenings came our way. At the Edinburgh Channel, where the troop
transports parted company and turned away for London, we were halted by an
urgent signal from a spurring torpedo-boat. 'Ships bound north to anchor
instantly,' was the reading of her flags; we rounded to and obeyed. In groups
and straggling units, we were joined by the larger number of the fleet that had left
the Downs with us. Some few were for the Thames and steamed ahead in wake
of the troop-ships, but the most were bound for east-coast ports and anchored
near the Channel Lightship. Two hours of precious daylight were lost to us
as we rode out the last of the flood. High water came and we swung around
on the cant of the wind. The pilot grew visibly impatient. The traverse of his
reckoning lessened in mileage with every hasty step or two up and down the bridge.
Yarmouth Roads receded into the morrow; Lowestoft (if the chief could crack
her up to thirteen) was possible, but unlikely. Time passed, with no clearing
signal&mdash;we were to be 'nipped' on the long stretch with no prospect but to dodge
into Hollesay Bay before black night came.</p>

<p>By some mysterious agency, the coasters developed a foreknowledge of
permission to proceed. Feathers of white steam curled from their windlasses,
and their anchors were awash before the block was signalled clear. They had
start of us. Less handily, we got under way and stood on into the Black Deep,
where the smaller craft were throwing green smoke in their efforts to get ahead.
The tide had now turned ebb to set us on our way. As we surged past the channel
buoys the pilot was reassured. The prospect of windy Lowestoft Roads
beckoned him on with every coaster we overhauled and passed; the outlook
improved as we timed our passage between the sea-marks. Off the Sunk, we
came on the cause of our stoppage. The pilot noted a new wreck on the sands,
one that had not been there when last he steered over this route. Beached at
high water, he said. She had not been long on. The wreck lay listed on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
spit of the sandbank. Her bows were blown open, exposing the interior of forecastle
and forehold. Neutral colours were painted on her topside; the boats
were gone and dangling boat-falls streamed alongside in the tideway. There
was no sign of life on her, but a patrol drifter was standing by with a crowd of
men on her decks. Out to seaward a flotilla of minesweepers was busily at work.
Turning no more than a curious eye on the mined neutral, the pilot paid attention
to the steering. That we were over a mined area had no grave concern for
him. Relying on the minesweepers, he kept course and speed&mdash;the channel was
reported clear.</p>


<h3><br />LIGHTSHIPS</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Devoted</span> to the service of humanity, in a bond that linked all seafarers,
lightships and isolated sea-beacons were regarded as exempted from the operation
of warlike acts. The claim of the 'beacons established for the guidance of
mariners' rested upon a high conception of world-wide service to mankind.
Their duties were not directed to military uses or to favouring alone the nation
who manned them. Their upkeep was met by a universal levy. Their warning
beams were not withdrawn from foreign vessels; no effort was made to establish
the nationality of a ship in distress ere setting portfire to the signal-gun to call
out the lifeboat. On rare occasions sea-rovers interfered with the operation
of the guide-marks. Retribution overtook them; they were outlawed by even
the loose opinion of the period. There is surely more than legend in the ballad
of Sir Ralph the Rover; if death by shipwreck was not actually his fate, it is at
least the penalty adjudged to him by popular acclaim. Smeaton, in his Folio,
records an instance of reparation for a similar 'diversion.'</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Lewis the Fourteenth being at war with England during the proceeding
with this building, a French privateer took the men at work upon the Eddystone
Rock, together with their tools, and carried them to France, and the
Captain was in expectation of a reward for the achievement. While the
captives lay in prison, the transaction reached the ears of that monarch.
He immediately ordered them to be released and the captors to be put in
their place: declaring that though he was at war with England, he was not
at war with mankind. He therefore directed the men to be sent back to
their work with presents, observing that the Eddystone Lighthouse was so
situated as to be of equal service to all nations having occasion to navigate
the Channel."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>A lightship is as peaceful and immobile as the granite blockstones of a lighthouse.
She requires an even greater protection, exposed as she is to dangers on
the sea that do not threaten the landward structure. She is incapable of offence
or defence. Unarmed, save for the signal-gun that is only used to warn a vessel
from the sands or to summon assistance to a ship in distress, she can offer no
resistance to a show of force. She is moored to withstand the strongest gales,
and cannot readily disengage her heavy ground-tackle. She has no efficient
means of propulsion; parted from her stout anchors, she would drive helplessly
on to the very shoals she had been set to guard. To all seafarers, in war
as in peace, she should appeal as a sea-mark to be spared and protected; in the
service of humanity, she is exposed to danger enough&mdash;to the furious gales from
which she may not run.</p>

<p>Unlike the Grand Monarch, the Germans are bitterly at war with mankind.
As one of their first war acts at sea, they shelled the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ostende'">Ostend</ins> Lightship. Like
the Lamb, she was using the water; the Wolf would suffer no protestation of her
innocency. Was she not floating placidly on the same tides that served the
German coast?</p>

<p>In view of his subsequent atrocities in torpedoing hospital ships and shelling
rafts and open boats, it is probable that our light-vessels would have been similarly
destroyed by the enemy, but that his submarine commanders found under-water
navigation required as accurate a check as in coasting on the surface. The fury
of the Wolf was, in his own interest, tardily suppressed. He recognized that the
value of the lightships in establishing a definite position was an asset to him.
Withal&mdash;his 'fix' decided&mdash;he had no qualms in sowing mines in the area of these
signposts; nor did he stay his hand in the case of a sea-mark that was not vital
to his plans. Two lightships on the east coast were blown up by mines; one, off
the coast of Ireland, was deliberately torpedoed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 435px;"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
<img src="images/i-112.jpg" width="435" height="600" alt="THE LAMPMAN OF THE GULL LIGHTSHIP" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE LAMPMAN OF THE GULL LIGHTSHIP</span>
</div>

<p>The menace of the German sea-mine remains the greatest war danger to which
the lightships are exposed. Zeppelin and seaplane pay visits to the coastal waters,
but the sea is wide for a chance missile from the air, and no great success has
attended their bombing efforts. But the enemy mine has no instant aim. Full-charged
and deadly, its activity is not confined&mdash;as the British mine is&mdash;to the
area of the mooring. Their minelayers, creeping in to the fairways in cloak of
the darkness, are anxious to settle their cargo of high explosive as quickly as
possible. Not all of the mines they sow hold to the hastily slipped 'sinkers'
till disaster to our shipping or the untiring search of the minesweepers reveals
their presence. Many break adrift and surge in the tideways, moving as the set
of the current takes them. Vessels under way, by keen look-out and ready helm,
can sight and avoid the drifting spheres, but the lightships have no power to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
steer clear. Moored on the offset of a shoal or sandbank (their position, indeed,
a guide to the minelayer), their broad bows offer contact to all flotsam that comes
down on swirl of the tide. The authorities were unwilling to expose their men
to a danger that could not be evaded, however gallant the shipmen or skilled
their seamanship. It was not a seagoing risk that could be met; no adequate
protection consistent with the lightship's mission could be devised. As the
submarine war became intensified, the more distant vessels were withdrawn;
new routes were set to divert shipping from the outer passages; only those
floating sea-marks are now maintained whose removal would entail disaster
to the traffic that passes by night and day.</p>

<p>Holding station in waters that are patrolled and, in part, protected, the Trinity
men who form the crews of the lightships have readjusted their manning. A
large proportion of the able-bodied men have joined the naval forces, leaving the
older hands (and some few who have a physical disability) to tend the lights.
War risks still remain, for the German minelayers have followed the shipping
to the inner channels, but the greybeards have grown stolid and immovable in a
service that was never at any time a safe and equable calling. They have become
sadly familiar with the new sea-warfare&mdash;with disaster to the shipping in the
channels. While they have incident enough, in the movement and activity of
patrols and war craft, in the ceaseless sweeping of the channels, to judge our sea-power
and take pride in its strength, they have all too frequent experience of the
murderous under-water mechanics of the enemy. Living in the midst of sea-alarms,
the old placid tedium of their 'sixty days' has given place to an excitement
that even the monotonous rounds of their small ship-life cannot suppress.
The men on the 'Royal Sovereign' were observers of the terrific power of the sea-mine;
three ships in sight being blown to small wreckage within an hour.
'Shambles' jarred to distant torpedoings off the Bill. The 'South Goodwin'
saw <i>Maloja</i> brought up in her stately progress by a thundering explosion, then
watched her list and settle in the stormy seaway; a second crash and upheaval
drew the eyes of the watch on deck to the fate of the <i>Empress of Fort William</i>
as she was hastening to succour the people of the doomed liner. Up Channel and
down, the lightshipmen were observers of the toll exacted by the enemy&mdash;the
price we paid for the freedom of the seas.</p>

<p>But not all their observations of sea-casualties brought gloom to the dog-watch
reckoning. If there remained no doubt of the intensity and power of German
submarine activity, they were equally assured of the efficiency of our surface
offence, and the deadly precision of our own under-water counter-measures.
On occasion, there were other sea-dramas enacted under the eyes of the lightshipmen&mdash;short,
swift engagements that set an oily scum welling over the clean sea-space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the channel, or an affair of rapid gunfire that cleared a pest from the
narrow waters. There is at least one instance of a lightship having a commanding,
if uncomfortable, station in an action between our drifters and a large enemy
submarine. The lampman of the 'Gull' had a front view.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Misty weather,
it was. Day was just breakin', about seven o' th' mornin' when I see him. I
see him just over there&mdash;a little t' th' nor'ard o' that wreckage on th' Sands. A
big fella, about th' size o' them oil-barges as passes hereabouts. I didn't make
him out at first&mdash;account o' th' mornin' haze, but there was somethin' over
there where no ship didn't oughta be. I calls down th' companion&mdash;'Master,'
I says, 'there's somethin' on th' north end o' th' Sands.' He comes up an' has a
look. Then we made 'im out what he was, a big German sub.&mdash;but he hadn't no
flag flyin'. Jest then we hears firin', an' th' shells goes over us an' lands nigh
him. They was three drifters jes' come out o' th' Downs t' start sweepin' an',
all three, they goes for him like billy-o&mdash;firin' as they comes. We was right
atween them an' th' shots passes over th' lightship. One as was short just pitches
clear an 'undred yards ahead o' us. Two guns he had&mdash;th' sub.&mdash;an' they didn't
half make a din as they goes at it&mdash;<i>bang-bang-bang!</i> Th' drifters passes us,
goin' a full clip. The first one, she got hit a-top th' wheelhouse, but they didn't
stop for nothin'. The' keeps bangin' away with th' gun.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes. Some shots
landed hereabouts, but we was busy watchin' th' drifters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I see their
shots hittin', too. I see one blaze up on th' submarine's deck, an' one o' his
guns didn't talk back no more. Th' drifters was steerin' straight for him. I
dunno how one o' them didn't go ashore herself&mdash;near it, she was. The sub.
was hard on by this time, an' he stands high&mdash;with a list, too, but fightin' away
like he was afloat.</p>

<p>"Two more drifters come up an' they joins in, an' th' shells goes <i>who-o-o-o!</i>
overhead again. Then a destroyer, he comes tearin' along at full speed, an'
he puts th' finishin' touch to him. There was an explosion on th' submarine, an'
th' nex' we see&mdash;we see his men tumblin' out o' him overside t' th' Sands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Them up t' their middles in th' water an' holdin' their hands up."</p>

<p>The lampman was, of his service, a trained observer. He said nothing of
the scene on the deck of the lightship&mdash;the watch tumbling up from below,
their clothing hastily thrown on&mdash;the questioning, the alarmed cries. His concern
was directed to the happenings on spit of the Sands. "Some shots landed
hereabouts," he said; but his interest was on the Goodwins.</p>

<h3>'THE PRICE O' FISH'</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE inshore patrol hailed us and reported the channel clear as far as the
Nore, and we stood on at full speed, making the most of the short winter
daylight. Past the Elbow buoy, we met the minesweepers returning
from a sweep of their section. They were steaming in two columns, line ahead,
and we sheered a little to give them room; within the reading of our Admiralty
instructions, they were a 'squadron in formation,' to whose movements we were
advised to give way. They passed close. The leader of the port column was
<i>Present Help;</i>   we read the name on a gilt scroll that ornamented her wheelhouse.
For the rest, she was trim in a coat of iron-grey, with her port and number
painted over. A small gun&mdash;a six-pounder, perhaps&mdash;was mounted on her
bows, and she carried a weather-stained White Ensign aloft. She scurried
past us, pitching to our bow wash in an easy sidling motion that set her
wheelhouse glasses flashing a cheery message. The skipper leaned from an open
doorway, in an attitude of ease that, somehow, assured us of his day's work
being well done&mdash;with no untoward happenings. He waved his cap to our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
greeting. <i>Present Help</i> and her sisters went by, and we returned to our course
in the fairway.</div>

<p>"These lads," said the pilot, waving his arm towards the fast-receding flotilla.
"If it wasn't for these lads, Capt'n, you and I wouldn't feel exactly comfortable
on the bridge in channel waters. Two went up this week, and one a little while
agone." He turned his palms upward and raised both arms in an expressive
gesture.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Three gone, one with all hands, but only one merchant ship done
in by mines hereabouts in the last month. (<i>Starboard, a little, quartermaster!</i>).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I dunno how we could carry on without them. Out there in all weathers,
clearing the fairways and&mdash;Gad!&mdash;it takes some doing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was talking to one
of the skippers in Ramsgate the other day. Saying what I'm saying&mdash;(<i>Steady,
now, steady's you go!</i>)&mdash;what I'm saying now, and all he said was&mdash;'Right,
pilot,' he says. 'If you feels that way, remember it when we gets back to th'
fishin' in peace-time, an'&mdash;for th' Lord's sake&mdash;keep clear o' our gear when th'
nets is down! I lost a tidy lot o' gear,' he says, 'with tramps an' that bargin'
about on th' fishin' grounds.'.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He didn't think nothing of this minesweeping.
His mind was bent on his nets and the fish again." A pause, while he conned the
ship on a steady course, then, reflectively, "An' there's some folks&mdash;there's
folks ashore growling about the price o' fish!"</p>

<p>Of courage in the war, on land as on sea, there are few records comparable
to the silent devotion of the fishermen. The heat of attack and fury of battle
may call out a reckless heroism that has no bounds to individual gallantry, but
the sustained courage required for a lone action under heavy odds&mdash;every turn
of the engagement being assessed and understood&mdash;is of a rarer quality; mere
physical health and high spirit cannot generate it; tradition of a sea-inherence
and long self-training alone can bring it forth. That the fishermen (inured to a
life of bold hazard and hardship) would offer valuable service in emergency
was never doubted, but that the level of their gallantry should reach such
heights, even those who knew them were hardly prepared to assume. And we
were weak in our judgment, for their records held ample evidence by which we
should have been able to predict a bravery in war action no less notable than their
courage in the equally perilous ways of their trade. For a lifetime at war with
the sea, wresting a precarious living from the grudging depths, their skill and
resolution required no stimulus under the added stress of sea-warfare. In the
fury of the channel gales, shipwreck and disaster called forth the same spirit of
dogged endurance and elevating humanity that marks their new seafaring under
arms. The countless instances of their service to vessels in distress, to torpedoed
merchantmen and warships, in the records of strife, are but repetitions of their
sea-conduct throughout the years of their trading. When Rozhdestvensky's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
panic-stricken gunlayers opened fire on the 'Gamecock' fleet on the Dogger, the
story of that outrage was distinguished by the same heroism of the trawlermen
that ennobles their diary to-day. When the <i>Crane</i> was sinking, the crew of <i>Gull</i>,
themselves suffering under fire, boarded her to rescue the survivors.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "When
they got on board the <i>Crane</i> they found the living members of the crew lying
about injured. The vessel was in total darkness, and it was known that at
any moment she might founder; yet Costello (the <i>Gull's</i> boatswain) went below
to the horrible little forecastle to bring up Leggatt's dead body. Smith (the
second hand), who took charge of the <i>Crane</i> when the skipper was killed, refused
to leave her till every man had been taken off. Rea (the engineer) showed unyielding
courage when, in spite of the fact that the little ship was actually
foundering, he groped back to the engine-room, which was in total darkness, to
reach the valves. The stokehold was flooded with water, and Rea could do
nothing. He went on deck, where the skipper was lying dead, and all the survivors,
except the boy, were wounded."</p>

<p>In all its bearings, the comradely action of the <i>Gull</i> was but a foreshadowing
of <i>Gowan Lea's</i> assistance to <i>Floandi</i> in the raid by Austrian cruisers on the drifter
line in the Adriatic. The circumstances were curiously alike&mdash;the actual occurrence,
the individual deeds. We have Skipper Nichols refusing to leave until
his wounded were embarked, and Engineman Mobbs groping (as Rea did) through
the scalding steam of <i>Floandi's</i> wrecked engine-room to reach the stokehold and
draw the fires. Then, as in the Russians' sea-panic of October 1904, the fishermen
(fighting seamen now) came under a sudden and murderous gunfire at close
range. Overpowered by heavy armament, there was no flinching, no surrender.
<i>Gowan Lea</i> headed for the enemy with her one six-pounder spitting viciously.
The issue was not considered&mdash;though Skipper Joseph Watt must have had no
doubt that he was steering his drifter towards certain destruction. Her gun was
quickly put out of action. Her funnel and wheelhouse were riddled and shot to
pieces. Water made on her through shot-holes in the hull. On the gun-platform,
her gunlayer struggled to repair the mechanism of the breech&mdash;his leg
dangling and shattered. Shell-torn and incapable of further attack, she drifted
out of the line of fire. Bad as was her own condition, there were others in worse
plight. <i>Floandi</i> had come under direct point-blank fire, and her decks were a
shambles. Out of control&mdash;her main steam-pipe being shot through&mdash;seven dead
or badly wounded, and only three remaining to work her, she was in dire need of
assistance. Skipper Watt observed the distress of his sea-mate and steered
<i>Gowan Lea</i> down to her to offer the same brotherhood as of the <i>Gull</i> to
<i>Crane</i>. The analogy is peculiarly complete: the boarding, the succour to
the wounded, the reverent handling of the dead. Not as a new spirit born<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of the stress of war, but as the outcome of an age-old tradition, Gowan Lea
stood by.</p>

<p>After four years of warfare at sea, serving under naval direction and discipline,
one would have expected the fisherman sailing under the White Ensign to lose
at least a certain measure of his former character&mdash;to have become a naval seaman
in his habits of thought, in his actions, his outlook. Four years of constant
service! A long term! He has come under a control that differs as poles
apart from the free days of 'fleeting' and 'single boating.' He is set to service
in unfamiliar waters and abnormal climates, but the habits of the old trade still
cling to him. New gear comes to his hands&mdash;sweeps, depth-keepers, explosive
nets, hydrophones, and paravanes&mdash;but he regards them all as adaptations to his
fishing service. He is unchanged. He is still fishing; that his 'catch' may
be a huge explosive monster capable of destroying a Dreadnought does not seem
to have imposed a new turn to his thoughts. He is apart from the regular naval
service. The influence of his familiar little ship, the association of his kindred
shipmates, the technics of a common and unforgettable trade, have proved
stronger than the prestige of a naval uniform. In his terms and way of speech,
he draws no new farrago from his brassbound shipmate. Did not the skipper
of the duty patrol hail <i>Aquitania</i> on her approach to the Clyde booms and advise
the captain?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 'Tak' yeer <i>bit boatie</i> up atween thae twa trawlers!'</p>

<p>The devotion and gallantry and humanity of the fishermen is not confined
to the enlisted section who man the patrol craft and minesweepers. The regular
trade, the old trade, works under the same difficulties and dangers that ever
menaced the ingathering of the sea-fishery. Serving on the sea in certain areas,
the older men and the very young still contrive to shoot the nets and down the
trawls. Their contribution to the diminished food-supply of the country is
not gained without loss; 'the price o' fish' is too often death or mutilation or
suffering under bitter exposure in an open boat. The efforts of the enemy to
stop our food-supply are directed with savage insistence towards reducing the
rations drawn from the deeps of the sea; brutality and vengeful fury increase
in intensity as the days pass and the indomitable fishermen return and return
to their grounds. In August 1914, fast German cruisers and torpedo-boats
raided our fleets on the Dogger Bank. Twenty fishing vessels were sunk, their
crews captured. There was no killing. ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The sailors [of the torpedo-boat]
gave us something to eat and drink, and we could talk and were pretty free,"
said the skipper of <i>Lobelia</i>. Later, on being taken ashore ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with German
soldiers on each side of us, and the women and boys and girls shouting at us and
running after us and pelting us, we were marched through the streets of Wilhelmshaven
to a prison." Hardship, abuse! Now ridicule! ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Germans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
stripped us of everything we had.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But they were not content with that&mdash;they
disfigured us by cutting one half of the hair of our heads off and one half
of the moustache, cropping close and leaving the other half on, making you as
ugly as they could.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was a nasty thing to do; but we made the best of it,
and laughed at one another."</p>

<p>Hardship, abuse, ridicule! The fishermen still served their trade at sea.
Now, brutality! The third hand of <i>Boy Ernie</i> details the callous precision of
German methods in September 1915. The smack was unarmed. ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was
very heavy and deliberate fire. [There were two enemy submarines.] The shots .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were
coming on deck and going through the sails. We threw the boat
overboard and tumbled into her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I started sculling the boat away from
the smack, all the time under fire; but the Germans were not content with firing
shells at a helpless craft&mdash;they now turned a machine-gun on to defenceless
fishermen in a boat on the open sea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The boat was getting actually riddled
by the machine-gun fire, and before I knew what was happening, I was struck
by a bullet on the right thigh, and began to bleed dreadfully.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The smack
was blown to pieces and went down. This was the work of one of the submarines&mdash;while
she was sinking the smack the other was firing on us."</p>

<p>Throughout all the malevolent and calculated campaign of destruction, the
fishermen remain steadfast to their old traditions of humanity. When <i>Vanilla</i>
is torpedoed without warning and vanishes in a welter of broken gear, her sea-mate,
<i>Fermo</i>, dodging a second torpedo, steams to the wreckage to rescue the
survivors&mdash;but finds none. In a heavy gale, <i>Provident</i> of Brixham risks her
mast and gear, gybing to close the sinking pinnace of the torpedoed <i>Formidable</i>,
and rescue the exhausted seventy-one men who crowded her. The instances of
fisher help to merchantmen in peril are uncounted and uncountable.</p>

<p>In the distant days when the Sea Services were classed apart, each in its own
trade and section&mdash;working by a rule that admitted no co-partnery&mdash;we foreign
traders had little to do with those whom (in our arrogance) we deemed the
'humble' fishermen. In the mists of the channel waters, we came upon them
at their trawls or nets. Their floats and buoys obstructed our course; the small
craft, heading up on all angles, confused the operation of a 'Rule of the Road.'
Impatient of an alteration that took us miles from a direct course, we felt somewhat
resentful of their presence on the sea-route. That they were gathering and
loading a cargo under stress and difficulty that contrasted with <i>our</i> easy stowage
in the shelter of a dock or harbour, did not occur to us; they were obstructionists,
blocking our speedy passage with their warps and nets and gear. Although most
masters grudgingly steered clear, there were those in our ranks who elected
to hold on through the fleets, unconcerned by the confusion and risk to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
fishermen's gear that their passage would occasion. There were angry shouts
and protests; the gear and nets were often the sole property of the fishermen;
serious losses were sustained.</p>

<p>At war, we have incurred debts. When peace comes and the seas are free
again, we shall have memories of what we owe to the fishermen in all the varied
services they have paid to us. The minesweepers toiling in the channels, that we
may not meet sudden death; patrols riding out bitter weather in the open
to warn us from danger, to succour and assist the remnants of our manning when
a blow goes home. War has purged us of many old arrogant ways. When next
we meet the fishing fleet at peaceful work in the channels, we shall recall the
emotion and relief with which we sighted their friendly little hulls bearing down
to protect us in a menaced seaway. We shall 'keep clear o' th' gear when th'
nets is down.'</p>

<h3>THE RATE OF EXCHANGE</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE Bank of England official, who had been a close attendant on the bridge
during the early part of the voyage, seems now to be reassured. We
are nearing land again. Another day should see us safely berthed at
New York, where&mdash;his trust discharged&mdash;a pleasant interval should open to him
ere returning to England. The gold and securities on board are reason for his
passage; he is with us as our official witness, should the activity of an enemy
raider compel us to throw the millions overboard. Nothing has happened. The
'danger zone' has been passed without event. Stormy weather on the Grand
Banks has given way to light airs and a smooth sea as we steer in to make our
landfall.</div>

<p>Together on the navigation bridge, we are discussing the shipment. ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It is the exchange, Captain," he says. "The exchange is against us. These
huge war purchases in the States cannot be balanced by the moderate exports
we are able to send over. When we left Liverpool the sovereign was worth
four dollars, seventy-one cents in America. I don't know where it is going to
end. We can't make securities. There must be a lim&mdash;&mdash;" Drumming of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
wireless telephone cuts in on his words. "Operator wishes to know if he can
leave the 'phones, sir? Says he has to see you."</p>

<p>The bridge messenger turns aside inquiringly, holding out the receiver
of the telephone as a context to his words. The request, that would have
aroused an instant disquiet six days ago, now appears trivial and normal.
There may be receipts to be signed. Approaching port the operator will be
completing his accounts. We are unconcerned and resume our conversation
until he arrives.</p>

<p>He is insistent that it cannot be due to atmospherics. "A queer business,
sir. Thought it best to report instead of telephoning. Some station addressing
a message to ABMV [all British merchant vessels], and another trying to jam it
out. Can't get more than the prefix, when jamming begins. No, not atmospherics.
I've taken ABMV, though distant, twice in this watch, and, looking
up the junior's jottings for the last watch, I see he had traces. Whatever is
jamming the message out is closer to us than the sender. I dunno what to make
of it!"</p>

<p>"You mean that a message from a land station to us is being interfered with,
deliberately, from somewhere near at hand?"</p>

<p>He produces the slip of his junior's scribbles. Among the jumble of noughts
and crosses, there is certainly a hastily scrawled ABMV, then x's and x's. "What
else, sir? At first I thought it was atmospherics&mdash;x's were fierce last watch&mdash;but
x's can't happen that way twice running!"</p>

<p>"All right! Carry on again. Let me know at once if anything further.
Gear to be manned continuously from now on. Keep your junior at
hand."</p>

<span class="caption">&#39;OUT-BOATS&#39; IN A MERCHANTMAN</span>
</div>

<p>A queer business! We trim the possibilities in our mind. It is now nearly
dark. As we go, we should make Nantucket Lightship at daybreak; our usual
landfall on the voyage. There is not much to work on. 'A message being sent,
and some one making unusual efforts to prevent receipt.' A raider? It is now
some months since <i>Kronprinz Wilhelm</i> was driven into Norfolk; she cannot
surely, have escaped internment. <i>Karlsruhe?</i> Nothing has been heard of her
for a long term. A submarine? Perhaps <i>Deutschland</i>, with his torpedo-tubes
refitted and a gun mounted? He knows the way; he could carry oil enough to
reach the coast, do a strafe, and sneak into a port for internment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Figuring
on the chart, measuring distance and course and speed, it comes to us that
enemy action would best succeed off Nantucket or the Virginia Capes. We
resolve to cut in between the two, to make the land below Atlantic City, and take
advantage of territorial waters. If there is no serious intention behind the jamming
of the wireless, there will be no great harm done&mdash;we shall only lose ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
hours on the passage; if a raider is out, we shall, at least, be well off the expected
route. We pass the orders.</p>

<p>A quiet night. We are steering into the afterglow of a brilliant sunset.
The mast and rigging stand out in clear black outline against lingering daylight
as we swing south four points. The look-out aloft turns from his post and scans
the wake curving to our sheer; anon, he wonders at the coming of a mate to
share his watch. Passengers, on a stroll, note unusual movement about the boat-deck,
where the hands are swinging out lifeboats and clearing the gear. As the
carpenter and his mates go the rounds, screwing blinds to the ports and darkening
ship, other passengers hurry up from below and join the groups on deck; an
excitement is quickly evident. They had thought all danger over when, in thirty
degrees west, we allowed them to discard the cumbersome life-jackets that they
had worn since leaving the Mersey. And now&mdash;almost on the threshold of
security and firm land&mdash;again the enervating restrictions and routine, the sinister
preparations, the atmosphere of sudden danger. Rumours and alarms fly from
lip to lip; we deem it best to publish that the wireless has heard the twitter of a
strange bird.</p>

<p>Before midnight, the bird is identified. Our theories and conjectures are
set at rest. The operator, changing his wave-length suddenly from 600 to 300
metres, succeeds in taking a message. '<i>From Bermuda</i>'&mdash;of all places&mdash;'<i>to
ABMV German armed submarine left Newport eighth stop take all precautions ends</i>.'
A submarine! And we had thought the limits of their activity stopped at
thirty degrees west. Even the Atlantic is not now broad enough! The definite
message serves to clear our doubts. A submarine from Newport will certainly
go down off Nantucket. Our course should now take us ninety miles south of
that. There remains the measure of his activity. A fighting submarine that
can navigate such a distance is new to us. His speed and armament are unknown.
We can hardly gauge his movements by standards of the types we know.
We are unarmed; our seventeen knots top speed may not be fast enough for an
unknown super-submarine. Crowded as we are by civilian passengers, we cannot
stand to gunfire. A hit will be sheer murder. It is a problem! We return to
the deck and make three figures of that ninety miles.</p>

<p>The pulse of the ship beats high in the thrust and tremor of the engines,
now opened out to their utmost speed; the clean-cut bow wave breaks well
aft, shewing level and unhindered progress. In the calm weather, the whirl of
our black smoke hangs low astern, joining the sea and sky in a dense curtain;
we are prompted by it to a wish for misty weather when day breaks&mdash;to make a
good screen to our progress. Though dark, the night is clear. A weak moon
stands in the east, shedding sufficient light to brighten the lift. We overhaul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
some west-bound vessels in our passage and warn them by signal. Two have
already taken Bermuda's message and are alert, but one has no wireless, and is
heading up across our course. We speak her; her lights go out quickly, and
she turns south after us.</p>

<p>Daybreak comes with the thin vapours of settled weather that may turn to a
helpful haze under the warm sun. We zigzag in a wide S from the first grey
half-light, for we are now due south of the Lightship. In the smooth glassy
surface of the sea we have an aid to our best defence&mdash;the measure of our eyes.
We note a novel vigilance in the watchkeepers, a suppressed anxiety that was not
ours in the infinitely more dangerous waters of the channels. The unusual
circumstance of zigzagging and straining look-out for a periscope almost in
American waters has gripped us. Every speck of flotsam is scanned in apprehension.
The far-thrown curl of our displacement spitting on the eddy of the
zigzag, throws up a feather that calls for frequent scrutiny. We have no lack
of unofficial assistance in our look-out. From early morning, the passengers are
astir&mdash;each one entrammelled in a life-jacket that reminds them continually of
danger. For the children, it is a new game&mdash;a source of merriment&mdash;but their
elders are gravely concerned. Gazing constantly outboard and around, they add
eyes to our muster. Every hour that passes without event seems to increase the
tension; the size and numbers of enemy vessels grow with the day. A telegraph-cable
ship at work is hailed as 'a raider in sight'&mdash;a Boston sea-tug, towing
barges south, is taken for a supply-ship with submarines in tow.</p>

<p>The wireless operator reports from time to time. The 'humming bird'
(whoever he is) has ceased jamming. The air is full of call and counter-call.
Halifax is working with an unknown sea-station&mdash;long messages in code. Coastal
stations are joined in the 'mix-up.' Cape Cod is offering normal 'traffic' to
the American steamer <i>St. Paul</i>, as though there was no word of anything happening
within reach of the radio. It is all very perplexing. Perhaps the Bermuda
message was a hoax; some 'neutral' youth on the coast may have been working
an unofficial outfit, as had been done before. Anon, an intercepted message
comes through. A Hollands steamer sends out '<i>S.O.S.</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>S.O.S.</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.'
but gives no name or position. Then there is silence; nothing working, but
distant mutterings from Arlington.</p>

<p>Throughout the day we swing through calm seas, shying at each crazy angle
of the zigzag in a turn that slows the measured beat of the engines. Night coming
and the haze growing in intensity, we use the lead&mdash;sounding at frequent
intervals&mdash;and note the lessening depth that leads us in to the land. At eight,
we reach six fathoms&mdash;the limit of American territorial waters. It is with
no disguised relief we turn north and steer a straight course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Although now less concerned with the possibility of enemy interference,
we have anxiety enough in the navigation of a coastal area in hazy weather.
We reduce speed. The mist has deepened to a vapour that hangs low in the
direction of the shore. House lights glimmer here and there, but only by the lead
are we able to keep our distance. A glow of light over Atlantic City shews itself
mistily through a rift in the haze and gives an approximation of our latitude,
but it is Barnegat's quick-flashing lighthouse beam that establishes our confidence
and enables us to proceed at better speed. We shew no lights. For all we are in
American waters, we have not forgotten <i>Gulflight</i> and <i>Nebraskan</i> and other
international 'situations'; we look for no consideration from the enemy and
preserve a keen look-out. Vessels pass us in the night bound south with their
deck lights ablaze, but we stand on up the coast with not a glimmer to show our
presence. Turning wide out to the shoal-water off Navesink, we sight the pilot
steamer lying to. We switch on all lights and steer towards her.</p>

<p>It is not often one finds the New York pilots unready, but our sudden arrival
has taken them aback. We have to wait. Daybreak is creeping in when the
yawl comes alongside with our man. He is an old Swedish-American whom we
had long suspected of pro-German leanings, but the relief and enthusiasm on his
honest old face is undisguised. "Gott! I am glat to see yo, Cabtin," he calls.
"Dere vas a rumour dat yo vas down too! Yoost now, ven yo signal de name
of de ship, I vas glat&mdash;glat!" He is full of his news; there are rumours and
rumours. 'The White Star mailboat is down,' 'a Prince liner is overdue,'
'there are fears for a Lamport and Holt boat.' In view of our safe arrival, he
is prepared to discount the rumours. What is certain is that U 53 has arrived
in these waters, and has already sunk six large ships off Nantucket.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A day later we turn to the commercial pages of the <i>New York Herald</i>. Our
arrival is reported, and it seems that the sovereign is now worth $4.72-1/16!</p>

<h3>INDEPENDENT SAILINGS</h3>


<div class='cap'>UNTIL nearly three years of war had gone on, we sailed independently
as 'single' ships, setting our speeds and courses and conforming only
to the general route instructions of the Admiralty. The submarine
menace did not come upon us in a sudden intensity. Its operation was gradually
unfolded and counter-measures were as methodically advanced to meet it. The
earliest precaution took the form of a wide separation of the ships, branching
the sea-routes apart on the sound theory that submarines would have voyaging
to do to reach their victims. While this was a plan of value on the high seas,
it could not be pursued in the narrower waters of the channels. Destroyers in
sufficient numbers not being available to patrol these waters, fishing craft&mdash;trawlers
and drifters&mdash;were commissioned to that service. Being of moderate
speed, their activities were not devoted to a mass operation, by which they
could group the merchantmen together for protection. The custom was still
to separate them as widely as possible, each zigzagging on her own plan. Until
the convoy system was established, measures for our protection did not take the
form of naval escorts sailing in our company: such vessels were only provided
for transports or for ships on military service: vessels on commercial voyages
were largely left to their own resources when clear of harbour limits.</div>

<span class="caption">FIREMEN STANDING BY TO RELIEVE THE WATCH</span>
</div>

<p>That all sea-going vessels should carry a wireless installation was one of the
first measures enforced by Admiralty. The magnificent resources of the Marconi
Company, though strained, were equal to the task. There was a life-labour
alone in the technical education of their operators, but they drilled the essentials
of their practice into landward youths in a few months&mdash;blessed them with a
probationer's licence&mdash;and sent them to sea. It is idle to speculate on what we
could have done without this communication with the beach: it is inconceivable
that we could have served the sea as we have done. Throughout the length of
channel waters, we were constantly in visual touch with the patrols, but in the
more open seas we relied on the wireless to keep us informed of enemy activities.
At first, we were lavish in its use. The air was scored by messages&mdash;'back
chat' was indulged in by the operators. An <i>S.O.S.</i> (and they were frequent)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was instant signal for a confusion of inquiries&mdash;a battery of call and counter
call&mdash;that often prevented the ready succour of a vessel in distress. We grew
wiser. We put a seal on the switch. Regulations came into force to restrain
unnecessary 'sparking'; we sat in to listen and record, and only to speak when
we were spoken to.</p>

<p>Codes were issued by the Admiralty for use at sea. Their early cryptogram
was easily decoded by friend and enemy alike. Knowing that certain words
would assuredly be embodied in the text of a message (words such as, <i>from</i>&mdash;<i>latitude</i>&mdash;<i>report</i>&mdash;<i>submarine</i>&mdash;<i>master</i>),
it was not difficult to decipher a code
of alphabetical sequence. There were famous stories of traitors and spies, but
our authoritative simplicity was responsible for the occasional leakage of information.
At this date, 1915-16, wireless position-detectors came into use by the
enemy. A spark-group, repeated after an interval, could give a fair approximation
of distance and course and speed. More than ever it was necessary to
maintain silence when at sea. Withal, the air was still in strong voice. At
regular periods the great longshore radios threw out war warnings to guide us
in a choice of routes and warn us away from mined areas. Patrols and war craft
kept up an incessant, linking report. Distress signals hissed into the
atmosphere in urgent sibilance, then faltered and died away. On occasion, the
high note of a <i>Telefunken</i> set invited a revealing confidence that would lead us,
'chicky-chicky,' to the block. We were well served by Marconi.</p>

<p>Extension of the power of enemy submarines brought new practice to our
seafaring. We had made the most of a passage by the land, steering so close
that the workers in the fields paused in their toil and waved us on; but the
new under-water craft crept in as close, and mined the fairways. We were
ordered to open sea again, to steer the shortest course by which we could reach a
depth of water that could not be mined. Zigzag progress now assumed the
importance that was ever its right. It had been but cursorily maintained. The
'shortest distance between two points' had, for so long, been our rule that
many masters were unwilling to steer in tangents. On passage in the more
open sea, they were soon converted to a belief in the efficacy of a crazy course.
Statistics of our losses proved the virtue of the tangent: of a group of six vessels
sunk in a certain area only one&mdash;a very slow vessel&mdash;was torpedoed while maintaining
a zigzag. Extracts from the diary of a captured submarine commander
were circulated among us, giving ground for our confidence, in the frequent
admissions of failure&mdash;"owing to a sudden and unexpected alteration of course."</p>

<p>Still, we were unarmed. If, by zigzag and a keen look-out, we were fortunate
in evading torpedo attack, the submarine had by now mounted a surface armament,
and we were exposed to another equally deadly offence. For our protection,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Admiralty placed a new type of warship on the routes approaching the
channels. Built originally for duty as minesweepers, the sloops were faster
and more heavily armed than the drifters. They patrolled in a chain of five or
six over the routes that we were instructed to use. During the daylight hours
we were rarely out of sight of one or other of the vessels forming the chain. Our
route orders were framed towards a definite point of departure into the high
seas when darkness came. There, the patrol of the sloops ended: we had the
hours of the night to make our offing and, by daybreak again, were assumed to
be clear of the 'danger zone.' But the 'danger zone' was being extended
swiftly; it was not always possible to traverse the area in the dark hours of a
night: only the fast liners could stretch out a speed that would serve. Profiting
by experience that was constantly growing, the <i>Reichsmarineamt</i> constructed
larger submarines capable of remaining long at sea, and of operating in ocean
areas that could not adequately be patrolled. Twelve, fifteen&mdash;then twenty
degrees of longitude marked their activity advancing to the westward: they
went south to thirty-five: in time the Mediterranean became a field for their
efforts. Gunfire being the least expensive, they relied on their deck armament
to destroy unarmed shipping. The patrols were but rarely in sight;
the submarine became a surface destroyer. There was no necessity for submergence
on the ocean routes: under-water tactics were held in reserve for use
against fast ships&mdash;the slower merchantmen were brought-to in a contest that
was wholly in favour of the U-boat. In a heavy Atlantic gale, <i>Cabotia</i> was sunk
by gunfire, 120 miles from land. She had not the speed to escape. Despite the
heavy seas that swept over the submarine and all but washed the gunner from
the deck, the enemy was able to keep up a galling fire that ultimately forced the
master to abandon his ship. <i>Virginia</i> was fired upon at midnight when steering
for the Cerigo Channel. Notwithstanding the courage of Captain Coverley, who
remained on board to the last, there could be but one end to the contest. <i>Virginia</i>
was sunk. A strong ship; the enemy had to expend two of his torpedoes to
destroy her.</p>

<p>Against such attacks only one measure could be advocated&mdash;the measure
we had for so long been demanding. It was impossible to patrol adequately
all the areas of our voyaging. Guns were served to us and we derived a confidence
that the enemy quickly appreciated. We did not expect wholly to reduce his
surface action, but we could and did expose him to the risk he had come so far
out to sea to avoid. On countless occasions our new armament had effect in
keeping him to his depths, with the consequent waste of his mobile battery power.
Even in gun action he could no longer impose his own speed power on a slow
ship. Under conditions that he judged favourable to his gunnery, the submarine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
commander still exercised his ordnance&mdash;usually after a torpedo had failed to
reach its mark. Many of the hazards were against us, but our weapons brought
the contest to a less unequal balance. If we did present the larger target, we
had&mdash;in our steady emplacement&mdash;a better platform from which to direct our
fire. From the first it was a competition of range and calibre. Six-pounders
led to twelves; these in turn gave way to 4.7's. Anon, the enemy mounted
a heavier weapon, to which we replied by a new type of 4-inch, sighted to 13,000
yards.</p>

<p>Thus armed and equipped, we were in better condition to meet the enemy
in our independent sailings. He was again obliged largely to return to the use
of his torpedoes, with all the maze of under-water approach that that form of
attack involved. If outranged in a surface action, we had our smoke-producing
apparatus to set up a screen to his shell-fire, and that form of defence had the
added value of forcing him to proceed at a high and uneconomical speed to press
an attack. Some of our gun actions resulted in destruction of a sea-pest, but
all&mdash;however unsuccessful&mdash;contributed to lessen his power of offence. Every
torpedo fired, every hour of submergence, every knot of speed expended in a
chase, was so far a victory for us as to hasten the date when he would be obliged
to head back to his base. His chances of survival in that passage through the
patrols and the nets and mines could not be considered as good.</p>

<h3>BATTLEDORE AND SHUTTLECOCK</h3>

<div class='center'>
"<i>All vessels are prohibited from approaching within four miles of Rathlin Island<br />
between sunset and sunrise</i>"<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>IN view of Admiralty instructions, we are 'proceeding as requisite'&mdash;turning
circles, dodging between Tor Point and Garron Head&mdash;and awaiting daybreak
to make a passage through Rathlin Sound. Steering south from
the Clyde, we had reached Skullmartin when the wireless halted us. Enemy
activity off the south coast of Ireland had become intensified, and all traffic
from west-coast ports was ordered to proceed through the North Channel. In
groups and singles, the ships from Liverpool and the Bristol Channel join us,
and we make a busy channel-way of the usually deserted coastal waters. We
show no lights, but the moon-ray reveals us, sharply defined, as we pass and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
repass on the lines of our courses. We keep well within the curve of the coast
until the light grows in the east, then turn finally to the north. The sun comes
up as we reach Fair Head, and we stand on towards the entrance of the Sound.</div>

<p>In the first hour of official clearance, the North Channel is busy with the
traffic. Outside as well as within, ships have been gathering in anticipation of
Admiralty sunrise. The seaway over by the mainland shore is scored and lined
by passage of the inward-bound vessels, all pressing on at their best speed to
make their ports before nightfall. A strong ebb tide runs through, favouring
our company of outward-bounders. We swing past Rue Point in a rip and
whirl that gives the helmsman cause for concern, cross the bight of the Bay at
a speed our builders never contemplated, and round the west end of the Island
before the sun has risen high.</p>

<p>It is fine weather in the Atlantic. Only the slight heave of an under-running
swell, and the rips and overfalls of the tide, mark the smooth surface of the sea:
the light north airs that come and go have no strength to ruffle the glassy patches.
Everything promises well for speedy progress. The engines are opened out to
their utmost capacity. Already we have drawn ahead of the press of shipping
that marked time with us on the other side of the channel. Our only peer, a
large Leyland liner, has opened out abeam of us and the whirl of black smoke
at his funnel-tip shows that he is prepared to make and keep the pace. 'To
proceed at such a time as to reach 56&deg; 40' North, 11&deg; West, by nightfall'&mdash;is
the reading of our new route orders. We shall have need of the favour of the
elements if we are to reel off 200 miles between now and 10 p.m. Anon, we pass
Oversay and the Rhynns of Islay and head for a horizon that has no blue mountain-line
to break the level thread of it. Our sea-mates of the morning are hull
down behind us&mdash;the slower vessels already turning west on the inner arms of
the fan formation that is devised to keep us widely separated in the 'danger
area.' Only the Leyland boat remains with us. We steer on a similar mean
course, but the angles of our independent zigzags make our progress irregular
in company. At times we sheer a mile or more apart, then close perceptibly
to crossing courses. She has perhaps the better speed, but her stoking is
irregular. Drawing ahead for a term, she shows us her broad sternwash in a
flurry of disturbed water; then comes the cleaning of the fires&mdash;we pull up and
regain a station on her beam.</p>

<p>So, till afternoon, we keep in company&mdash;pressing through the calm seas at
a speed that augurs well for our timely arrival in 11&deg; West. We sight few
vessels. A lone drifter on patrol speaks us and reports no enemy sighted in the
area: an auxiliary cruiser with a destroyer escorting her passes south on the
rim of the landward horizon. A drift of smoke astern of us hangs in the clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
air, then resolves to a fast Cunarder that speedily overhauls and passes us. As
though impressed by the mail-boat's progress, our sea-mate puts a spurt on and
maintains a better speed than any she has shown since morning. She draws
ahead and we are left with clear water to exercise the cantrips of our zigzag.</p>

<p>An <i>allo</i> is intercepted by the wireless in the dog-watch. (We have coined a
new word to report an enemy submarine in sight, a word that cannot offer a
key to our codes.) It comes from the Cunarder, now out of sight ahead. We
figure the radius on the chart, and bear off six points on a new course to keep
well clear of the area. The Leyland liner is by now well ahead and we note she
has turned to steer west. There is a slight difference in our courses and we
draw together again as we steam on. The wireless operator now reports that
a vessel near at hand has acknowledged the Cunarder's <i>allo</i>. Shortly a man-o'-war
sloop appears in sight and passes north at high speed, steering towards the
position we are avoiding.</p>

<p>The second officer keeps a keen look-out. He has had bitter experience of
the power of an enemy submarine and is anxiously desirous that it should not
be repeated. A 'check' on the distant sea-line (that we had taken for the peak
of a drifter's mizen) draws his eye. He reports a submarine in sight&mdash;broad on
the port bow. The circle of our telescope shows the clean-cut horizon ruling a
thread on the monotint of sea and sky. Sweeping the round, a grey pinnacle
leaps into the field of view. It is over-distant for ready recognition. Only by
close scrutiny, observing a hair-line that rises and falls on either side of the grey
upstanding point, are we able to recognize our enemy. He is pressing on at full
speed, trusting to our casual look-out, that he may secure a favourable position
to submerge and attack. Our fine confidence with which we have anticipated
such a meeting gives place to a more sober mood. Though not yet in actual
danger, there is the former <i>allo</i> to be thought of&mdash;the possibilities of a combination.
Quick on recognition, we alter course, steering to the north again. The
gun, already manned, is brought to the 'ready,' and the intermittent crackle
of the wireless sends out an urgent warning. The Leyland steamer starts away
at first sight of our signals: ahead, grey smoke on the horizon marks where the
patrol sloop has gone hull-down.</p>

<p>A spurt of flame throws out from the distant submarine. He has noted our
sudden alteration of course and knows that he has now no prospect of reaching
torpedo range unobserved. His shell falls short by about a thousand yards.
We reply immediately at our extreme elevation, but cannot reach him. The
next exchange is closer&mdash;he is evidently overhauling us at speed. Mindful of
our limited fifty rounds, we telephone to the gun-layer to reserve his fire until
he has better prospect of a hit. Two shots to our one; the enemy persists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
though he does not now seem to be closing the range. Our seventh shot pitches
close to him, and ricochets. There is a burst of flame on his deck&mdash;whether
from his gun or the impact of our shell we shall never know; when the spume
and spray fall away he has dived.</p>

<p>Suddenly, it is recalled to us that we have been, for over half an hour, steering
into the radius of the Cunarder's <i>allo</i>. The patrol sloop has turned to close us
and is rapidly approaching. A decision has quickly to be made. If we stand
on to keep outside torpedo range of our late antagonist, we may blunder into the
sights of number two. North and east and west are equally dangerous: we
may turn south-east, but our course is for the open sea. The sloop sheers round
our stern and thunders up alongside. Receiving our information, her helm goes
over and she swings out to investigate the area we have come from. We decide
to steer to the north-west as the shortest way to the open sea.</p>

<p>We have the luck of the cast. As we ease helm to our new course, the ship
jars and vibrates&mdash;a thundering explosive report comes to our ears. The
Leyland liner close on our starboard quarter has taken a torpedo and lies over
under a cloud of spume and debris.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<h3>ON SIGNALS AND WIRELESS</h3>


<div class='cap'>FOR war conditions our methods and practice of signalling were woefully
deficient. In sailing-ship days the code was good enough; we had no
need for Morse and semaphore. We had time to pick and choose our
signals and send them to the masthead in a gaudy show of reds and blues and
yellows. Our communications, in the main, were brief and stereotyped. "What
ship? Where from? How many days out? Where bound? Good-bye&mdash;a
pleasant passage!" Occasionally there was a reference to a coil of rope or
a tierce of beef, but these were garrulous fellows. The ensign was dipped.
We had 'spoken'; we would be reported 'all well!'</div>

<p>Good enough! There were winches to clean and paint, bulwarks to be chipped
and scaled, that new poop 'dodger' to be cut and sewn. "Hurry up, there,
you sodgerin' young idlers! Put the damned flags in the locker, and get on
with the <i>work!</i>  "</p>

<p>With steam and speed and dispatch increasing, we found need for a quicker
and more instant form of signal correspondence. New queries and subjects
for report grew on us, and we had to clip and abbreviate and shorthand our
methods to meet the lessening flag-sight of a passing ship. We altered the
Code of Signals, adding vowels to our flag alphabet. We cut out phrases like
'topgallant studding sail boom' and 'main spencer sheet blocks,' and introduced
'fiddley gratings' and 'foo-foo valve.' Even with all our trimming,
the book was tiresome and inadequate. We began to fumble with Morse and
semaphore, with flashlights and wig-wags and hand-flags.</p>

<p>We did it without a proper system. As a titbit to our other 'snippings,'
medicine, the Prayer Book, the law, ship's business, the breeches buoy, ship-cookery!
Fooling about with flags and tappers and that, was all very well for
the watch below, but there was <i>work</i> to be done&mdash;the binnacles to be polished,
the sacred <i>suji-mudji</i> to be slapped on and washed off!</p>

<p>Hesitating and slipshod and inexact as we were, at least we made, of our
own volition, a start; a start that might, under proper and specialized direction,
have made an efficient and accurate addition to the sum of our sea-lore. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
we were wedded to titbits. Late on the tide, as usual, the Board of Trade
woke up to what was going on. They added a 'piece' to our lessons, without
thought or worry as to the provision of facilities for right instruction. We
crammed hard for a few days, fired our shot at the right moment, and forgot all
about it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 242px;">
<img src="images/i-140.jpg" width="242" height="400" alt="THE BRIDGE-BOY REPAIRING FLAGS" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE BRIDGE-BOY REPAIRING FLAGS</span>
</div>

<p>Withal, in our own amending way,
we were enthusiastic. We learned the
trick of <i>Ak</i> and <i>Beer</i> and <i>Tok</i> and <i>Pip</i>.
We slapped messages at one another
(in the dog-watches), in many of which
a guess was as good a translation as any.
Our efforts received tolerating and
amused recognition from naval officers
(secure in possession of scores of highly
trained signal ratings). If we came,
by chance, across an affable British warship,
she would perhaps masthead an E
(exercise), to show that there was no ill-feeling.
Then was the time to turn out
our star man, usually the junior-est
officer, and set him up to show that we
were not such duffers, after all! Alas!
The handicaps that came against us!
The muddled backgrounds (camouflage,
as ever was!), the fatal backthought
to a guess at the last word! The
call and interfering counter-call from
reader to writer, and writer to reader,
and, finally, the sad admission&mdash;an
inevitable <i>Eye</i>, <i>emmer</i>, <i>eye</i> (I.M.I.&mdash;please repeat), when our scrawl and jumble
of conjectural letters would not make sense! We have yet a mortifying memory
of such an incident, in which a distant signalman spelt out to us, clearly and
distinctly, "<i>Do you speak English?</i>"</p>

<p>Under the stress of war we have improved. Fear for the loss of important
information has spurred us to keener appreciation. If you promise not to
flirt the flags backhanded (a most damnably annoying habit of superior, <i>flic-flac</i>
Navy men) we can read you in at ten or twelve words a minute. For single-ship
work, that was good enough; if we had a press of signalling to attend, we could
make up for our busy time in leisurely intervals. But convoy altered that. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the Naval Service a signalman has nothing whatever to do in the wide world but
attend to signals. It is his only job: a highly trained speciality. With us the
demands of ship work on our bare minimum crews do not allow of a duty signaller;
he must bear a hand with the rest to straighten out the day's work. In convoy,
with signals flying around like crows at the harvest, we found our way of it unworkable.
It resolved itself to what used to be called a 'grand rally' in pantomime&mdash;all
hands on the job, and the officer of the watch neglecting a keen look-out
to see that note of the message was kept properly.</p>

<p>The naval authorities took counsel. The experiment had been a 'try on,'
in which they (with their large staff of special signalmen) had assessed our ability
as greater than their own! It was decided to train signalmen&mdash;R.N.V.R.&mdash;for
our service. Pending their formation and development, we were given skilled
assistance from the crews of our ocean escorts. But for our gun ratings, and
they mostly R.N.R., we had no experience of the regular Navy man in our muster.
He spun a bit, trimming the grass, before he found rest and a level. With us
only for a voyage, we did not get to know him very well, but in all he was competent
enough.</p>

<p>One we had, from H.M.S. <i>Ber&mdash;Sharpset</i>, Private Henry Artful, R.M.L.I.
Drouthy, perhaps, but a good hand. At the end of sailing day, when the flags
were made up and stowed, he came on the bridge.</p>

<p>"Fine night, sir!" We assented, curiously; democratic and all as we are,
it is rather unusual for our men to be so&mdash;so sociable. "Larst capt'in I wos with,
sir, 'e allus gimme a drink after th' flag wos stowed."</p>

<p>We stared, incredulous. "What! Do you say the captain of <i>Sharpset</i>
gave you a drink when your work was done?" He started in affright. "Not
the capt'in o' <i>Sharpset</i>, sir! Oh no, sir!&mdash;Gawd!&mdash;No! Th' capt'in o' th'
larst merchant ship wot I wos signallin' in!"</p>

<p>His horror, genuine and unconcealed, at our suggestion of such an unheard-of
transaction, gave illustration alike of the discipline in His Majesty's ships and,
sadly, the lack of it in ours.</p>

<p>In time our quickly trained R.N.V.R.'s joined. They came from Crystal
Palace, these new shipmates. Clean fellows&mdash;smart. Bacon-curers, Cambridge
men, lawyers, shopmen, clerks, haberdashers&mdash;trimmed and able and willing to
carry on, and lacking only a little ship practice, and a turn of sea-legs, to fit them
for a gallant part in delivering the goods. With their coming we are introduced
to a line of longshore life that had escaped us. There is talk and ado of metropolitan
habits and styles, of 'Maudlen' and high life, of music scores, the latest
revue, the quips of the music-halls. ("When Pa&mdash;says&mdash;<i>turn</i>" is now the
correct aside, when Commodore gives executive for a new angle on the zigzag!)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>At the first we were somewhat concerned at the apparent 'idleness' of our
signalman. He was on our books for but one employment&mdash;the business of
flags and signals. In intervals of his special duties he made an odd picture on
the bridge of a merchant ship&mdash;a man without a 'job.' The firemen, on deck to
trim ventilators, would take a peep at him as at some strange alien; seamen,
passing fore and aft on their reliefs, would nod confidently. "Still diggin'
wet sand, mate?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wish I 'ad your job!" There were days when he was
busy enough&mdash;'windmilling' with the hand-flags, or passing hours in hoist and
rehoist when Commodore was sharpening the convoy to a precision in man&oelig;uvre,
but on open sea his day was not unduly crowded. There were odd hours of
'stand-by' under screen of the weather-cloth, intervals of leisure which he might
use as he liked, provided he kept a ready ear for the watch officer's call. Reading
was usual. In this his taste was catholic. <i>Tit-Bits</i> and <i>My Dream Novelettes</i>
found favour; one had back numbers of the <i>Surveyor and Municipal and County
Engineer</i>, old volumes of <i>Good Words</i> from the Bethel box found a way to the
bridge; we saw a pocket volume of Greek verse that belonged to the bold lad
who altered our signalled 'will' to 'shall'!</p>

<p>For all his leisured occupation he was quick enough when the call of "<i>Signals</i>"
brought him to business. His concentration on the speciality of the flags
brought an accuracy to our somewhat haphazard system of signalling. We
benefited in more than his immediate work by promoting his instruction of our
young seamen. Spurred, perhaps, by the knowledge of our quondam haberdasher's
efficiency, the boys improved rapidly under his tuition. We paid
a modest bonus on results. We are looking forward. We shall not have our
duty signalman with us when there is 'peace bacon' to be cured.</p>

<p>Another new shipmate who has signed with us is the wireless operator, the
lieutenant of Signor Marconi, our gallant <i>salvator</i> in the war at sea. If we may
claim for our sea-service a foremost place in national defence, it is only by grace
of our wireless we register a demand. Without it, we were undone. No other
system of communication would have served us in combat with the submarine;
<i>spurlos versenkt</i>, without possibility of discovery, would have been the triumph
of the enemy. If to one man we seamen owe a debt unpayable, Marconi holds
the bond.</p>

<p>Unthinking, we did not accept our new shipmate with enthusiasm. Before
the war he could be found on the lordly liners, tapping out all sorts of messages,
from the picture-post-card-like greetings of extravagant passengers to the deathless
story of <i>Titanic</i> and <i>Volturno</i>. We looked upon him as a luxury, only suited
to the large passenger vessels. We could see no important work for him in the
cargo-carriers; we could get on very well without a telegraph to the beach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
A week of war was sufficient to alter our views; we were anxious to have him
sign with us. Although he is now an important member of the crew, his reception
at first was none too cordial. The apparent ease and comfort of his office
rankled in contrast to the rigours of the bridge and the hardships of the engine-room.
His duties&mdash;specialized to one operation&mdash;we deemed unfairly light in
comparison with our jack-of-all-trades routine. In port, he was a lordling&mdash;no
man his master&mdash;able to come and go as the mood took him. Frankly, we were
jealous. Who was this to come among us with the airs of a full-blown officer, and
yet not a dog-watch at sea? Messed in the cabin too, and strutted about the
decks with his hands in his pockets, as bold and unconcerned as any first-class
passenger! We were puzzled to place him. He talked airily of ohms and static
leaks, ampere-hours and anchor-gaps, and yet, in an unguarded moment, had he
not told us of his experiences in a Manchester broker's office, that could have
been no more than six months ago? The airs of him! Absurd assumption of an
official confidence between the Old Man and himself, as if <i>he</i> had the weight of
the ship's safety on his narrow shoulders! As for his baby-brother assistant&mdash;that
kid with the rosy cheeks&mdash;everybody knows that all he does is to screw up
his 'jimmy fixin's' and sit down good and comfortable to read "The Rosary,"
with his dam mufflers on his ears! <i>Huh!</i></p>

<p>But we are wiser now! Here is a text for our conversion. It is a record
of a wireless conversation between a merchantman attacked and a British
destroyer steaming to her assistance from somewhere out of sight.</p>

<p>"Are you torpedoed?"</p>

<p>"Not yet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shots in plenty hitting. Several wounded. Shrapnel,
I believe. Broken glass all round me."</p>

<p>"Keep men below. Stick it, old man!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you bet. Say, the place stinks of gunpowder. Am lying on the
floor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have had to leave 'phones. My gear beginning to fly around
with concussion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Captain is dead.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."&mdash;an interval&mdash;"Submarine has
dived! Submarine has dived!"</p>

<p>Yes, we are wiser now! We admit him to full fellowship at sea. And on land,
too! We admit him the right to trip it in Kingsway or the Strand, with his kid
gloves, and his notebook, and his neat uniform, for his record has shown that
it does not require a four-years' apprenticeship to build up a stout heart; that
on his 'jimmy fixin's' and their proper working depends a large measure of
our safety; and if the crack does come and the air is thick with hurtling debris,
broken water and acrid smoke, our first look will be aloft to see if his aerial still
stands. We do him and baby brother the honour that we shall not concern
ourselves to wonder whether they be ready at their posts!</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<h3>TRANSPORT SERVICES</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE first State control of the merchants' ships began with the transports
employed to convey the Expeditionary Force to France in the early
days of August 1914. Vessels of all sizes and classes were commandeered
at the dockside to serve in the emergency. The comparatively short distance
across the channels did not call for elaborate preparation and refitment: the
times would admit of no delay. Ships on the point of sailing on their trading
voyages were held in dock, their cargo discharged in quantity to make space
for troops and their equipment. Lining-up on the quays and in the littered
dock-sheds, troops awaited the stoppage of unloading operations. With the
last sling of the 'tween-deck lading passed to the shore, they marched on board.
As the tide served, the vessels steamed out of dock and turned, away from their
normal routes, towards the coast of France.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></div>

<p>To serve as ballast weight, the stowage of cargo in the lower holds was frequently
left in place for the term of the vessel's troop service. Months, perhaps a year
later, the merchandise arrived at its destination. Consignees would wonder at its
tardy delivery&mdash;they could see no record of its itinerary as shewn by the bills of
lading, unless they read into the fine prefix&mdash;'War: the King's Enemies: restraints
of Rulers and Princes'&mdash;the romance of its voyaging with the heroes of Mons.</p>

<p>To transport the overseas troops from India and Canada and Australia,
different measures were necessary. The ships requisitioned for this service had
to be specially fitted for the longer voyage. The State was lavish and extravagant
under the sudden pressure of events. The many-handed control at the
ports made for an upheaval and dislocation of shipyard labour that did not
hasten the urgent dispatch of the vessels. The hysteria of the times gave excuse
for a squandering of valuable ship-tonnage that was without parallel. Large
liners, already fitted for carriage of passengers, were employed as prison and
internment ships. Curious situations arose in the disposal of others. At the
north end, a large vessel might suddenly be requisitioned and taken from her
trade&mdash;with all the consequent confusion and relay; by day and night the
work of fitting her would go on. South, a vessel of similar size and build might
be found, having her troop-fittings removed, in preparation for an ordinary
trading voyage. Still, if the end justifies the means, the ultimate results
were not without credit. The garrison troops from Malta and Egypt and
Gibraltar and South Africa were moved with a celerity that is unexampled; a
huge contingent from India was placed on the field in record time. A convoy
of thirty-one merchantmen brought Canadian arms to our assistance: Australians,
in thirty-six ships, crossed the Indian Ocean to take up station in Egypt.
The unsubsidized and singular enterprise of the merchants was proving its worth:
as vital to the success of our cause as the great war fleet, the merchants' ships
aided to stem the onrush in France and Flanders.</p>

<p>Considerations of economy followed upon the excited measures with which
the first transport of available troops was effected. In the period of training
and preparation for the long offensive, the Transport Department had opportunity
to organize their work on less stressful lines. It was well that there was
breathing-space at this juncture. Enemy interference, that had so far been
almost wholly a surface threat to our communications, grew rapidly to a serious
menace from under water. The engagement and organization of naval protection
underwent an immediate revisal. Heavily armed cruisers and battleships could
afford little protection against the activity of the German submarines, now at
large in waters that we had thought were overdistant for their peculiar man&oelig;uvres.
Destroyers and swift light craft were needed to sail with the transports.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The landing at Gallipoli, under the guns of the enemy, was a triumph for
the Transport Service. In the organization and disposal of the ships, the control
and undertaking that placed them in sufficient numbers in condition for their
desperate venture, the Department redeemed any earlier miscalculations. The
efficient service of the merchant masters and seamen was equally notable.
Under heavy fire from the batteries on shore they carried out the instructions
given to them in a manner that was "astonishingly accurate" and impressed
even the firebrands of the naval service. Strange duties fell to the merchant
seamen on that day. Compelled by the heavy draught of their ships to remain
passive spectators of the deeds of heroism on the beach, they saw ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whole
groups swept down like corn before a reaper, and to realize that among these
groups were men who only a short time before had bid us good-bye with a smile
on their lips, was a bitter experience.</p>

<p>"Our vessel was used to re-embark the wounded, and we stood close inshore
to make the work of boating them off less hazardous. We had three
doctors on board, but no nurses or orderlies, and the wounded were being brought
on board in hundreds, so it was a relief to us to doff our coats and lend a hand.
We had to bury the dead in batches; officers and men were consigned to the
deep together. On one occasion the number was exceptional, and the captain
broke down while reading the service.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." It was surely a bond of real brotherhood
that brought the shattered remnants of the complement she had landed
earlier in the day to meet their last discharge at the hands of the troopship's
seamen&mdash;their committal to the deep at the broken words of the vessel's master.</p>

<p>While the transport of troops in the Channel and the narrow seas was not,
at any time, seriously interfered with, the movements of the larger ocean transports
were not conducted without loss. <i>Royal Edward</i> was the first transport
to be torpedoed. She went down with the sacrifice of over a thousand lives.
The power of the submarine had been over-lightly estimated by the authorities:
measures of protection were inadequate. Improved U-boats were, by now,
operating in the Mediterranean, and their commanders had quickly acquired
a confidence in their power. More destroyers were required to escort the troopships.</p>

<p>By a rearrangement of forces a more efficient measure of naval protection
was assured. Although the provision of a swift escort did not always prevent
the destruction of ships, the loss of life on the occasion of the sinking of a
transport was sensibly reduced by the presence of accompanying destroyers.
The skill and high gallantry of their commanders was largely instrumental in
averting complete and terrible disaster. As the numbers of ships were reduced
by enemy action there came the need to pack the remaining vessels to a point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of overloading. Boat equipment on the ships could not be other than inadequate
when the certified complement of passengers was exceeded by 100 per cent.
In any case, the havoc of a torpedo left little time to put the huge numbers of
men afloat. With no thought of their own hazard&mdash;bringing up alongside a
torpedoed vessel and abandoning the safeguard of their speed and man&oelig;uvring
power&mdash;the destroyer men accepted all risks in an effort to bring at least the
manning of their charge to port.</p>

<p>Every casualty added grim experience to the sum of our resources in avoiding
a great death-roll. Life-belts that we had thought efficient were proved faulty
of adjustment and were condemned: methods of boat-lowering were altered
to meet the danger of a sudden list: the run of gangway and passage to the
life-apparatus was cleared of impediment. When on a passage every precaution
that could be taken towards a ready alert was insisted upon. Despite the manly
grumbling of the very young military officers on board, certain irksome regulations
were enforced. Life-belts had to be worn continuously; troops were only
allowed below decks at stated hours; systems of drill, constantly carried through,
left little leisure for the officers and men. Although no formal drill can wholly
meet the abnormal circumstances of the new sea-casualty, we left nothing undone
to prepare for eventualities. That our efforts were not useless was evident
from the comparatively small loss of life that has resulted from late transport
disasters.</p>

<p>The system of escort varies largely in the different seas. Homeward from
Canada and, latterly, from the United States the troopships are formed in large
convoys under the ocean escort of a cruiser. On arrival at a position in the
Atlantic within working distance of the destroyers' range of steaming, the convoy
is met by a flotilla of fast destroyers who escort the ships to port. For transport
work in the Mediterranean no such arrangement could be operated. Every
sea-mile of the great expanse is equally a danger zone. Usually, vessels of
moderate speed are accompanied by sloops or armed drifters, but the fast troopships
require destroyers for their protection. The long courses call for relays,
as the destroyers cannot carry sufficient fuel. Marseilles to Malta, Malta to
Suda Bay, Suda Bay to Salonika&mdash;a familiar voyage of three stages&mdash;required
the services of no less than five destroyers. The numbers of our escorting craft
were limited: it called for keen foresight on the part of the Naval Staff and
unwearying sea-service on that of the war craft to fit their resources to our
demands.</p>

<span class="caption">TRANSPORTS IN SOUTHAMPTON DOCKS</span>
</div>

<p>In the narrow seas, with the patrols more numerous and closely linked, the
short-voyage transports proceed on a time-table of sailings that keeps them
constantly in touch with armed assistance. The vessels are mostly of light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
draught and high speed. Whilom railway and pleasure craft, they make their
voyages with the exactitude of the rail-connections they served in the peaceful
days. Although many of them are built and maintained (and certificated by
the Board of Trade) for smooth-water limits only, the emergency of the times
has given opportunity of proof that their seaworthy qualities are underestimated
by the authorities. The high gales and dangerous short seas of the Channel
are no deterrent to their voyages; under the pressure of the continual call for
reinforcements on the Western Front, and serving the line of route from England
to the Continent, to Marseilles and beyond, they stand no hindrance. They
are specially the objects of enemy attention. Their high speed and rapid turning
power enables them to run moderately free of torpedo attack&mdash;though the
attempts to sink them by this weapon are frequent enough&mdash;but in the German
sea-mines they have a menace that cannot so readily be evaded. Many have
fallen victims to this danger, but the ready succour of the patrols has prevented
heavy loss of life. Though armed for defence, they have not had many opportunities
for gun action. Their keen stems are weapon enough, as Captain Keith
considered when he drove <i>Queen Alexandra</i> at full speed into an enemy submarine,
sinking him, and nipping a piece of his shorn hull for trophy.</p>

<p>Southampton is the principal base for the smaller transports. Large vessels&mdash;the
<i>Olympic</i> and her sisters&mdash;come and go from the port, but it is by the quick
turns of the smaller vessels that the huge traffic of the base is cleared. Tramping
through the streets of the ancient town to turn in at the dock gates, company
after company of troops file down the quayside to embark on the great adventure.
The small craft are berthed at the seaward end of the docks, and the drifting
white feathers at their funnel-tips marks steam up in readiness for departure.
The drab-grey of their hulls and decks is quickly lined by ochre tint of khaki
uniforms. There is no halt to the long lines of marching men, save on the turn
of the stream to another gangway. By long practice, the Naval Transport Staff
and the embarkation officers have brought their duties to a finished routine.
There is not here the muster, the enumeration, the interminable long-drawn
march and counter-march on the wharf-side, that is the case with the larger
ocean transports. Crossing the gangway, carrying pack and equipment, the
troops settle down on the decks in a closely packed mass.</p>

<p>Anon, with no undue advertisement, the transports unmoor from the quay
and steam down Southampton Water. Off St. Helens, the night covers them
and they steal out swiftly on the Channel crossing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />INTERLUDE</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">But</span> for the flat-topped dwellings, the domes and minarets, of the town that
stands in the alluvial valley, Suda Bay is not unlike a Highland loch in its loneliness
and rugged grandeur. The high surrounding mountains, the lofty snow-capped
summit of Psiloriti standing up in the east, the bare hill-side sloping to
the water with no wooded country to break the expanse of rock and heath, the
lone roadway by the fringe of the sea that leads to the wilds, are all in likeness to
the prospect of a remote Sutherland landscape. The darkling shadows on the
water, the play of sun and cloud on the distant uplands, completes the picture;
sheep on the hill-side set up plaintive calls that echo over the Bay.</div>

<p>The heavy westerly gale that was reason for our being signalled in from sea
has blown itself out, and the water of the Bay stands still and placid. All that
is left of the furious squalls of yesterday has not strength to keep us wind-rode
in the anchorage, and we cast about to the vagaries of the drift.</p>

<p>We were bound down from Salonika to Marseilles when ordered in. We
had expected to meet the relieving escort of destroyers at the Cerigo Channel,
but the bad weather had prevented them from proceeding at any but a slow
speed, and there was no prospect of their arrival at the rendezvous. So we
turned south to seek protection behind the booms at Suda Bay. We are a
packed ship. The shortage of transports has had effect in crowding the vessels
in service to a point far beyond the limits of their accommodation. We have
had to institute a watch-and-watch system among our huge complement. While
a proportion are seeking rest below, others crowd the upper decks, passing the
time as best they may until their turn of the hammocks comes round.</p>

<p>The fine weather after the late gale has brought every one on deck. The
doings of the ships in the anchorage have interest for the landsmen. Naval
cutters and whalers are out under oars for exercise, and thrash up and down the
Bay with the long steady sweep of practised rowers. Our escort of two destroyers
arrives&mdash;their funnels white-crusted from the heavy weather they have experienced
on passage from Malta. They engage the flagship with signals, then steam
alongside an oiler to take fuel for the return voyage. A message from the senior
officer is signalled to us to have steam raised, to proceed to sea at midnight.</p>

<p>Standing in from the Gateway, a British submarine comes up the Bay. She
moves slowly, as though looking for the least uncomfortable berth in the anchorage.
The oil-ship, having already the two destroyers alongside, cannot offer
her a place: she will have to lie off and await her turn. We put a signal on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
her, inviting her people to tie up alongside and come stretch their legs on our
broad decks. Instant compliance. She turns on a long curve, rounds our stern,
and her wires are passed on board.</p>

<p>The commander of the submarine gazes about curiously as he comes on
board. He confesses that he has had no intimate acquaintance with merchants'
ships. The huge number of our passengers impresses him, accustomed as he is
to the small manning of his own vessel. Standing on the navigation bridge, we
look out over the decks below at the khaki-clad assembly. The ship seems
brimming over with life and animation. There is no corner but has its group
of soldiers. They are everywhere; in the rigging, astride the derricks, over the
top of boats and rafts they are stretched out to the sun. Mess-cooks with their
gear push their way through the crowds; there is constant movement&mdash;the
men from aft barging forward, the fore-end troops blocking the gangways as
they saunter aft. Noisy! Snatches of song, hails, and shouts&mdash;the interminable
games of 'ouse with '<i>Clikety-clik</i> and <i>blind-forty</i>' resounding in the many local
dialects of the varied troops. High in spirit! We are the leave-ship, and they
are bound home for a long-desired furlough after the deadly monotony of trench-keeping
on the Doiran Front.</p>

<p>"Gad! What a crowd," he says. "I had no idea you carried so many.
They look so big&mdash;and so awkward in a ship. Of course, on a battleship we
muster a lot o' men, twelve hundred in the big 'uns, but&mdash;somehow&mdash;one never
sees them about the decks unless at divisions or that. Perhaps it's khaki does
it; one gets accustomed to blue in a ship."</p>

<p>A 'diversion' has been arranged for the afternoon. Dinner over, all troops
are mustered to a boat drill that includes the lowering of the boats. Since
leaving Salonika there has been no such opportunity as now offers. Despite
foreknowledge of the time of assembly it is a long proceeding. Our complement
is made up of small details&mdash;a handful of men from every battalion on the Front.
Officers set to their control are drawn from as many varied branches of the
service. The valued personal 'grip' of non-commissioned officers is not at our
disposal. There is no such order and discipline as would be the case if we were
manned by complete battalions. The routine of military movements seems dull
and lifeless at sea, however efficient it may prove on land. We are long on
the job.</p>

<p>By dint of check and repetition the grouping of the men at their boat stations
is brought to a moderate proficiency. The seamen at the boats swing out and
lower, and we set the boats afloat, each with a full complement of troops.
Embarked, and left to their own resources&mdash;with only one ship's rating to
steer&mdash;the men make a better show. The division of the mass into smaller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
bodies induces a rivalry and spirit of competition: they swing the oars sturdily
and make progress to and fro on the calm water of the Bay.</p>

<p>With the boats away full-loaded, we take stock of the numbers still mustered
on the deck. Considerably reduced, they are still a host. The boat deck, the
forecastle head, the poop&mdash;are all lined over by the waiting men: the empty
boat-chocks and the dangling falls inspire a mood of disquiet. Standing at
ease, they seem to be facing towards the bridge. Doubtless they are wondering
what we think of it all. The submarine's commander has been with us at our
station during the muster. We look at one another&mdash;thoughtfully.</p>


<h3><br />'THE MAN-O'-WAR 'S 'ER 'USBAND'</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A sense</span> of security is difficult of definition. Largely, it is founded upon habit
and association. It is induced and maintained by familiar surroundings. On
board ship, in a small world of our own, we seem to be contained by the boundaries
of the bulwarks, to be sailing beyond the influences of the land and of
other ships. The sea is the same we have known for so long. Every item of
our ship fitment&mdash;the trim arrangement of the decks, the set and rake of mast
and funnel, even the furnishings of our cabins&mdash;has the power of impressing a
stable feeling of custom, normal ship life, safety. It requires an effort of thought
to recall that in their homely presence we are endangered. Relating his experiences
after having been mined and his ship sunk, a master confided that the
point that impressed him most deeply was when he went to his room for the
confidential papers and saw the cabin exactly in everyday aspect&mdash;his longshore
clothes suspended from the hooks, his umbrella standing in a corner as
he had placed it on coming aboard.</div>

<p>Soldiers on service are denied this aid to assurance. Unlike us, they cannot
carry their home with them to the battlefield. All their scenes and surroundings
are novel; they may only draw a reliance and comfort from the familiar
presence of their comrades. At sea in a ship there is a yet greater incitement
to their disquiet. The movement, the limitless sea, the distance from the land,
cannot be ignored. The atmosphere that is so familiar and comforting to us,
is to many of them an environment of dread possibilities.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>

<span class="caption">THE <i>LEVIATHAN</i> DOCKING AT LIVERPOOL</span>
</div>

<p>It is with some small measure of this sense of security&mdash;tempered by our
knowledge of enemy activity in these waters&mdash;we pace the bridge. Anxiety is
not wholly absent. Some hours past, we saw small flotsam that may have come
from the decks of a French mail steamer, torpedoed three days ago. The passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of the derelict fittings aroused some disquiet, but the steady routine of our
progress and the constant friendly presence of familiar surroundings has effect
in allaying immediate fears. The rounds of the bridge go on&mdash;the writing of
the log, the tapping of the glass, the small measures that mark the passing of
our sea-hours. Two days out from Marseilles&mdash;and all well! In another two
days we should be approaching the Canal, and then&mdash;to be clear of 'submarine
waters' for a term. Fine weather! A light wind and sea accompany us for
the present, but the filmy glare of the sun, now low, and a backward movement
of the glass foretells a break ere long. We are steaming at high speed to make
the most of the smooth sea. Ahead, on each bow, our two escorting destroyers
conform to the angles of our zigzag&mdash;spurring out and swerving with the peculiar
'thrown-around' movement of their class. Look-out is alert and in numbers.
Added to the watch of the ship's crew, military signallers are posted; the boats
swung outboard have each a party of troops on guard.</p>

<p>An alarmed cry from aloft&mdash;a half-uttered order to the steersman&mdash;an
explosion, low down in the bowels of the ship, that sets her reeling in her stride!</p>

<p>The upthrow comes swiftly on the moment of impact. Hatches, coal,
shattered debris, a huge column of solid water go skyward in a hurtling mass to
fall in torrent on the bridge. Part of a human body strikes the awning spars
and hangs&mdash;watch-keepers are borne to the deck by the weight of water&mdash;the
steersman falls limply over the wheel with blood pouring from a gash on his
forehead.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then silence for a stunned half-minute, with only the thrust of
the engines marking the heart-beats of the stricken ship.</p>

<p>Uproar! Most of our men are young recruits: they have been but two
days on the sea. The torpedo has gone hard home at the very weakest hour
of our calculated drill. The troops are at their evening meal when the blow
comes, the explosion killing many outright. We had counted on a proportion
of the troops being on the deck, a steadying number to balance the sudden rush
from below that we foresaw in emergency. Hurrying from the mess-decks as
enjoined, the quick movement gathers way and intensity: the decks become
jammed by the pressure, the gangways and passages are blocked in the struggle.
There is the making of a panic&mdash;tuned by their outcry, "<i>God!</i> <i>O God!</i> <i>O
Christ!</i>" The swelling murmur is neither excited nor agonized&mdash;rather the
dull, hopeless expression of despair.</p>

<p>The officer commanding troops has come on the bridge at the first alarm.
His juniors have opportunity to take their stations before the struggling mass
reaches to the boats. The impossibility of getting among the men on the lower
decks makes the military officers' efforts to restore confidence difficult. They
are aided from an unexpected quarter. The bridge-boy makes unofficial use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of our megaphone. "Hey! Steady up you men doon therr," he shouts.
"Ye'll no' dae ony guid fur yersels croodin' th' ledders!"</p>

<p>We could not have done it as well. The lad is plainly in sight to the crowd
on the decks. A small boy, undersized. "Steady up doon therr!" The effect
is instant. Noise there still is, but the movement is arrested.</p>

<p>The engines are stopped&mdash;we are now beyond range of a second torpedo&mdash;and
steam thunders in exhaust, making our efforts to control movements by
voice impossible. At the moment of the impact the destroyers have swung
round and are casting here and there like hounds on the scent: the dull explosion
of a depth-charge&mdash;then another, rouses a fierce hope that we are not unavenged.
The force of the explosion has broken connections to the wireless room, but the
aerial still holds and, when a measure of order on the boat-deck allows, we send
a message of our peril broadcast. There is no doubt in our mind of the outcome.
Our bows, drooping visibly, tell that we shall not float long. We have
nearly three thousand on board. There are boats for sixteen hundred&mdash;then
rafts. Boats&mdash;rafts&mdash;and the glass is falling at a rate that shows bad weather
over the western horizon!</p>

<p>Our drill, that provided for lowering the boats with only half-complements
in them, will not serve. We pass orders to lower away in any condition, however
overcrowded. The way is off the ship, and it is with some apprehension we
watch the packed boats that drop away from the davit heads. The shrill ring
of the block-sheaves indicates a tension that is not far from breaking-point.
Many of the life-boats reach the water safely with their heavy burdens, but the
strain on the tackles&mdash;far beyond their working load&mdash;is too great for all to
stand to it. Two boats go down by the run. The men in them are thrown
violently to the water, where they float in the wash and shattered planking.
A third dangles from the after fall, having shot her manning out at parting of
the forward tackle. Lowered by the stern, she rights, disengages, and drifts
aft with the men clinging to the life-lines. We can make no attempt to reach
the men in the water. Their life-belts are sufficient to keep them afloat: the
ship is going down rapidly by the head, and there remains the second line of
boats to be hoisted and swung over. The chief officer, pausing in his quick
work, looks to the bridge inquiringly, as though to ask, "How long?" The
fingers of two hands suffice to mark our estimate.</p>

<p>The decks are now angled to the deepening pitch of the bows. Pumps are
utterly inadequate to make impression on the swift inflow. The chief engineer
comes to the bridge with a hopeless report. It is only a question of time. How
long? Already the water is lapping at a level of the foredeck. Troops massed
there and on the forecastle-head are apprehensive: it is indeed a wonder that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
their officers have held them for so long. The commanding officer sets example
by a cool nonchalance that we envy. Posted with us on the bridge, his quick
eyes note the flood surging in the pent 'tween-decks below, from which his men
have removed the few wounded. The dead are left to the sea.</p>

<p>Help comes as we had expected it would. Leaving <i>Nemesis</i> to steam fast
circles round the sinking ship, <i>Rifleman</i> swings in and brings up alongside at
the forward end. Even in our fear and anxiety and distress, we cannot but
admire the precision of the destroyer captain's man&oelig;uvre&mdash;the skilful avoidance
of our crowded life-boats and the men in the water&mdash;the sudden stoppage of her
way and the cant that brings her to a standstill at the lip of our brimming decks.
The troops who have stood so well to orders have their reward in an easy leap
to safety. Quickly the foredeck is cleared. <i>Rifleman</i> spurts ahead in a rush
that sets the surrounding life-boats to eddy in her wash. She takes up the
circling high-speed patrol and allows her sister ship to swing in and embark a
number of our men.</p>

<p>It is when the most of the life-boats are gone we realize fully the gallant
service of the destroyers. There remain the rafts, but many of these have been
launched over to aid the struggling men in the water. Half an hour has passed
since we were struck&mdash;thirty minutes of frantic endeavour to debark our men&mdash;yet
still the decks are thronged by a packed mass that seems but little reduced.
The coming of the destroyers alters the outlook. <i>Rifleman's</i> action has taken
over six hundred. A sensible clearance! <i>Nemesis</i> swings in with the precision
of an express, and the thud and clatter of the troops jumping to her deck sets
up a continuous drumming note of deliverance. Alert and confident, the naval
men accept the great risks of their position. The ship's bows are entered to
the water at a steep incline. Every minute the balance is weighing, casting her
stern high in the air. The bulkheads are by now taking place of keel and bearing
the huge weight of her on the water. At any moment she may go without
a warning, to crash into the light hull of the destroyer and bear her down. For
all the circling watch of her sister ship, the submarine&mdash;if still he lives&mdash;may
get in a shot at the standing target. It is with a deep relief we signal the captain
to bear off. Her decks are jammed to the limit. She can carry no more.
<i>Nemesis</i> lists heavily under her burdened decks as she goes ahead and clears.</p>

<p>Forty minutes! The zigzag clock in the wheelhouse goes on ringing the
angles of time and course as though we were yet under helm and speed. For
a short term we have noted that the ship appears to have reached a point of
arrest in her foundering droop. She remains upright as she has been since
righting herself after the first inrush of water. Like the lady she always was,
she has added no fearsome list to the sum of our distress. The familiar bridge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
on which so many of our safe sea-days have been spent, is canted at an angle
that makes foothold uneasy. She cannot remain for long afloat. The end will
come swiftly, without warning&mdash;a sudden rupture of the bulkhead that is sustaining
her weight. We are not now many left on board. Striving and wrenching
to man-handle the only remaining boat&mdash;rendered idle for want of the tackles
that have parted on service of its twin&mdash;we succeed in pointing her outboard,
and await a further deepening of the bows ere launching her. Of the military,
the officer commanding, some few of his juniors, a group of other ranks, stand by.
The senior officers of the ship, a muster of seamen, a few stewards, are banded
with us at the last. We expect no further service of the destroyers. The position
of the ship is over-menacing to any approach. They have all they can carry.
Steaming at a short distance they have the appearance of being heavily overloaded;
each has a staggering list and lies low in the water under their deck
encumbrance. We have only the hazard of a quick out-throw of the remaining
boat and the chances of a grip on floating wreckage to count upon.</p>

<p>On a sudden swift sheer, <i>Rifleman</i> takes the risk. Unheeding our warning
hail, she steams across the bows and backs at a high speed: her rounded stern
jars on our hull plates, a whaler and the davits catch on a projection and give
with the ring of buckling steel&mdash;she turns on the throw of the propellors and
closes aboard with a resounding impact that sets her living deck-load to stagger.</p>

<p>We lose no time. Scrambling down the life-ropes, our small company
endeavours to get foothold on her decks. The destroyer widens off at the
rebound, but by clutch of friendly hands the men are dragged aboard. One
fails to reach safety. A soldier loses grip and goes to the water. The chief
officer follows him. Tired and unstrung as he must be by the devoted labours
of the last half-hour, he is in no condition to effect a rescue. A sudden deep
rumble from within the sinking ship warns the destroyer captain to go ahead.
We are given no chance to aid our shipmates: the propellors tear the water in
a furious race that sweeps them away, and we draw off swiftly from the side of
the ship.</p>

<p>We are little more than clear of the settling fore-end when the last buoyant
breath of <i>Cameronia</i> is overcome. Nobly she has held afloat to the debarking
of the last man. There is no further life in her. Evenly, steadily, as we had
seen her leave the launching ways at Meadowside, she goes down.</p>

of practised seamanship. The task is burdened and complicated by powers
and conditions that call for auxiliary arts. It is true that the salvage officer's
ground, his main asset, is the knowledge and ability to do a seamanlike 'job o'
work' when the time and tide are opportune; he must have a seaman's training
in the ways of the wind and the sea and be able properly to assess the weather
conditions under which alone his precarious work is possible. A scientist of
a liberal and versatile type (not perhaps exhaustive in his scope and range),
he is able to draw the quantum of his needs from a wide and varied summary.
Together with his medical exemplar, he has developed a technique from
crude remedies and imperfect diagnoses to application of fine science. He
must have a sure knowledge of the anatomy of his great steel patients, be
versed in the infinite variety and intricacy of ship construction, and the valves
and arteries of their power; be able to pen and plan his formul&aelig; for weight-lifting&mdash;the
stress and strain of it, down to the calibre of the weakest link.
A super-tidesman, he must know to an inch the run of bottom, the swirl and
eddy, the value of flood and ebb and springs, for the tide&mdash;Canute's immutable
recalcitrant&mdash;is his greatest assistant, a familiar <i>Genius maris</i> whom he
conjures from the deeps of ocean to do his bidding. Shrewd! He is a
keen student of the psychology of the distressed mariner; again, like the
medical man, he must set himself to extract truth from the tale that
is told. His treatment must be prescribed, not to meet a case as presented,
but as his skilled knowledge of the probabilities warrants. Tactful,
if he is to meet with assistance in his difficult work, he must assume the
sympathy of one seaman to another in distress. What, after all, does it
matter if he agree heartily that "the touch was very light, we were going
dead slow," when, from his divers' reports, he knows that the whole bottom
is 'up'?</p>

<p>In the handling of his own men there must be a combination of rigour and
reason. Salvage crews are a hardy, tempestuous race who have no ordinary
regard for the niceties of law and order; their work is no scheduled and defined
occupation with states and margins; they are servants to tide and weather alone;
they are embarked on a venture, on a hazard, a lottery. To such men, administering,
under his direction, the heroic but destructive remedies of high explosive
and compressed air, there cannot be a normal allowance for the economic use
of gear and material. He must know the right and judicial discount to be made
that will meet the conflicting demands of the expenses department and the
results committee. Above all, he must be of an infinite patience, of the
mettle that is not readily discouraged. In the great game of seafaring his
hand holds the king of disappointment and the knaves of frustration and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
discouragement. But he has other cards; he holds an ace in stability and
determination.</p>

<p>Calm days and smooth seas may lure him to surpassing effort, to work through
the tides in feverish energy, making the most of favoured opportunity. The
scattered and interrupted work of months has perhaps been geared and bound, the
tackle rigged and set for a final dead lift. Buoyancy is figured out and assured;
the pumps are in place, throbbing and droning out, throwing steady streams
from the weight of water that so long has held the foundered wreck in depth.
The work has been long and trying, but an end to difficulty is in sight. Given
a day or two of continued fine weather, the sea and the rocks will have to
surrender their prisoner.</p>

<p>Comes a darkling to windward and the sea stirs uneasily; jets and spurts of
broken water appear over the teeth and spit of rocky ledges. The salvors look
around with calculating eyes and note the signs of a weather break. Still, there
is no slackening of effort; there may be time to complete the work before the
sea rises to interfere; if anything, the omens only call for another spur to the
flank, a new sting to the lash.</p>

<p>Beaten to the knees, the gear and tackle swaying perilously in breaking seas,
the lifting-barges thundering at their curbs, the pumps groaning and protesting
their inability to overcome the lap of blue water, there is no alternative but to
abandon the work and return to harbour. From the beach the salvage officer
may watch his labour of weeks&mdash;or months&mdash;savagely undone in an hour or two
of storm and fury of the sea!</p>

<p>It is a great catalogue, that schedule of virtues and accomplishments. To
it must be added, as a supplement, that he must be a 'made' man&mdash;made in a
long hard pupilage in a stern school that appraises strictly on results. It is of
little use to show that, in theory, a certain course was right and proper, when
the broad but damning fact remains that the property is still in Davy Jones his
locker, and likely&mdash;there to remain. Many are called, but few are chosen.
The salvage service has no room for the merely mediocre officer: the right man
goes inevitably to his proper place, the wrong one goes back to a junior, and less
responsible, post at sea.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if the Naval Service could produce the type required. Their
candidate would be, to a degree, inelastic. He would be an excellent theorist,
a sound executant, a strict disciplinarian; but his training and ideas would fit ill
to the wide range of conflicting interests, and the shutting out of all man&oelig;uvre,
however skilled and stimulating&mdash;but that of securing a maximum of result
by a minimum of effort. Perhaps it was for these reasons our salvage services
before the war were almost wholly mercantile and commercial. Certainly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
most Admiralty efforts in this direction were confined to ports and harbours
where method could be ordered and controlled by routine; their more arduous
and unmanageable cases on the littoral were frequently handed over to the merchantmen&mdash;not
seldom after naval efforts had been unavailing. Among the
protestations of our good faith to the world in time of peace, it may be cited
that we made no serious provision for a succession of maritime casualties; there
was no specially organized and equipped Naval Salvage Service. True, there
were the harbour gear, divers, a pump or two, and appliances and craft for
attending submarine accidents, but their energies were bent largely to humane
purposes&mdash;to marine first aid. Of major gear and a trained personnel to control
equipment and operation there was not even a nucleus. Salvage was valued at
a modest section of the "Manual on Seamanship" (written by a mercantile
expert), and a very occasional lecture at the Naval College. At war, and the toll
of maritime disaster rising, the need grew quickly for expert and special service.
There was no longer a relative and profitable balance to be struck between value
of sea-property and cost of salvage operations. A ship had become beyond
mere money valuation; as well assess the air we breathe in terms of finance. No
cost was high if a keel could be added to our mercantile fleets in one minute
less than the time the builders would take to construct a new vessel. The call
was for competent ship-surgeons who could front-rank our maritime C Threes.
By whatever skill and daring and exercise of seamanship, the wrecks must be
returned to service. Happily, there was no necessity to go far afield; the merchants'
salvage enterprise, like the merchants' ships and the merchants' men,
was ready at hand for adoption.</p>

<span class="caption">IN A SALVAGE VESSEL: OVERHAULING THE INSULATION OF THE POWER LEADS</span>
</div>

<p>The Salvage Section, Admiralty, is a dignified caption and has an almost
imperial address, but, camouflages and all, it is not difficult to see the hem of
old sea-worn garments of our mercantile companies peeping out below the gold
braid. If in peace-time they did wonders, war has made their greatest and
most successful efforts seem but minor actions compared to their present-day
victories. The practice and experience gained in quick succession of 'cases'
has tuned up their operations to the highest pitch of efficiency. New and
more powerful appliances have come to their hands; a skilled and technical
directorate has liberated initiative. Strandings, torpedo or mine damage,
fire, collisions&mdash;frequently a compound of two or three&mdash;or all five&mdash;provide
them with occasion for every shift of ingenuity, every turn of resource.
There is no stint to the gear, and no limits to invention, or device, if
there is a possibility of a damaged ship being brought to the dry docks. Is
it not on record that an obstinate, stranded ship, driven high on the beach,
was finally relaunched on the crest of an artificially created 'spring' tide,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the wash and suction of a high-speed destroyer, plying and circling in the
shallows?</p>

<p>Many new perils are added to the risks and hazards of their normally dangerous
work. Casualties that call for their service are rarely located in safe and
protected waters; open coast and main channels are the marches of the Salvage
Section, where the enemy has a keen and ready eye for a 'potting' shot by
which he may prevent succour of a previous victim. The menace of sea-mines
is particularly theirs; the run and swirl of Channel tides has strength to weigh
a stealthy mooring and carry a power of destruction up stream and down. They
have a new and deadly danger to be guarded against in the ammunition and
armament of their stricken wards. Many have gone down at 'action stations,'
and carry 'hair-sprung' explosive charges, the exact condition and activity
of which are usually a matter for conjecture. It calls for a courage of no ordinary
measure to grope and stumble under water amid shattered wreckage for the safety-clutch
of the charges, or grapple in the mud and litter for torpedo firing-levers.
This the pioneer of the divers must do, as the first and most important of his
duties.</p>

<p>With skill enhanced by constant and encouraged practice, they set out to
bind the wounds and raise our damaged ships to a further lease of sea-activity.
So definite and sure are their methods, so skilled and rapid their execution, they
steam ahead of reconstruction and crowd the waiting-room at the dry-dock
gates. Lined up at the anchorage awaiting their turn, the recovered vessels
may be crippled and bent, and showing torsion and distress in the list, and
staggering trim with which they swing flood and ebb. They may rest, halting,
on the inshore shallow flats, but, laid by for a term of repair, their day is to
come again. The Salvage Section has reclaimed their rent and stranded hulls
from the misty sea-Front; the Repair Section, working day and night, will
hammer and bind and reframe the gaps of their steel; the Sea Section will take
them out on the old stormy road, sound and seaworthy, with the flag at the
peak once more.</p>


<h3><br />A DAY ON THE SHOALS</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> rigger was engaged at second tucks of a five-inch wire-splicing job, and
hardly looked in the direction we indicated. "Them," he said. "Them's
crocks wot we don't want nothin' more t' do with! Two on 'em's got frozen
mutton. High? Excelsi-bloody-or! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an' that feller as is down by th' 'ead&mdash;Gawd!
'e don't 'arf smell 'orrible!" A pause, while he hammered down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the strands and found fault with his assistant, gave us time to disentangle the
negatives of his opening. "Grain, she 'as&mdash;an' of all th' ruddy messes wot I
ever see&mdash;she gets it! We 'ad four days at 'er&mdash;out there 'n th' Padrig Flats,
an' she sickened nigh all 'ands! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now we're well quit o' 'er, an' th' longshore
gangs is unloadin' th' bulk, in nosebags an' gas 'elmets, t' get 'er a-trim for th'
dry dock!"</div>

<p>As we passed alee of the grain-carrier there was no doubt of the truth of the
rigger's assurance. Steam-pumps on her fore-deck were forcing a sickly mixture
of liquid batter through hoses to a barge alongside, and the overpowering stench
of the mess blew down to us and set eyes and noses quickening with instant
nausea. The men on the barges were garbed in odd headgear, high cowls with
staring circular eyepieces, and each carried a knapsack cylinder on his back.
Clouds of high-pressure steam from the winches and pumps threw out in exhaust,
and the hooded, ghost-like figures of the labourers passed and repassed in drifts
of white vapour. To the hiss and rumble of machines, clamour of block-sheaves
and chain and piston joined action to make a setting of <i>Inferno</i>, the scene might
well be imagery for a stage of unholy rites.</p>

<p>Past her, we turned to the clean salt breeze again and stood on to the open
sea. The salvage officer, a Commander, R.N.R., joined us at the rail. "What
about that now? Sa&mdash;lubrious?" he said.</p>

<p>We wondered how men could be got to work in such an atmosphere, how it
was possible to handle such foul-smelling litter in the confined holds.</p>

<p>"Oh! We go through that all right. A bit inconvenient and troublesome,
perhaps, working in a restricting gas-rig; but now, the chemists have come to
our assistance and we can sweeten things up by a dose of anti-stink.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But
you won't see that to-day. Our 'bird' has got no cargo, only clean stone
ballast&mdash;a soft job."</p>

<p>The 'soft job' had had a rough time, a combination and chapter of sea and
war hazard. Inward bound from the United States with a big cargo, a German
torpedo had found a mark on her. She settled quickly by the stern, but the
undamaged engines worked her gallantly into a small seaport where she brought
up with her main deck awash. There she was lightened of her precious load,
temporary baulks and patches were clamped and bolted to her riven shell-plate,
and she set off again on a short coastwise voyage to the nearest port where definite
and satisfactory repair could be effected. Off the Heads, the enemy again got
sights on her. Crippled, and steaming at slow speed to ease strain on the bulkheads,
she made a 'sitting' target for a second torpedo, that shattered rudder
and stern-post and sheared the propellor from the shaft.</p>

<p>"We came on her just before dark," said the commander.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of the crew were in the boats, close by, but the captain and a Trinity pilot and
others were still aboard. She was down astern to the counter and up forward
like a ruddy unicorn. We got fast and started to tow. Tow?&mdash;Might as well
have taken on the Tower Bridge. There was no way of steering her, and a
strong breeze from the south'ard blew her head down against all we could do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyway,
we hung on, and at daylight in the morning the wind let up on
us a bit, and we guided her drift&mdash;that's about all we could do&mdash;inshore, till
she took the bottom on good ground a little north of the Westmark Shoal. We
filled her up forrard as the weather was looking bad&mdash;a good weight of water
to steady her through a gale. She's lain out there for two months now. We've
had a turn or two at her occasionally&mdash;shoring up the after bulkheads and that,
while we had weather chances. <i>Titan</i> has been out at her since yesterday morning.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It
looks good and healthy now." He cast an eye around appreciatively
at the calm sea and quiet sky, the gorse-banked cliffs dimmed by a promising
summer haze, at seagulls lazily drifting on the tide or becking and bowing
in the glassy ripples of our wash. "Good and healthy; I like to see these old
'shellbacks' sitting low and not shrilling overhead with all sail set.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If
this weather holds I shouldn't wonder if we get the old bus afloat on high tide
to-day!"</p>

<p>Clear of harbour limits and heading out to the shoals, a brisk rigging of gear
and tackle brings action to the decks of the salvage steamer. Already we had
thought the narrow confines from bulwark to bulwark congested by the bulk
of appliances, but, from hole and corner and cunning stowage, further coils and
shoots and lengths of flexible, armoured hose are dragged and placed in readiness
for operations. Derricks are topped up and purchases rove for handling the
heavy twelve-inch motor-pumps. Hawsers are uncovered and coiled clear, stout
fenders thrown over in preparation for a grind alongside the wreck. Mindful
of possibilities, the engineer-lieutenant and his artificers go over the insulation
of their power leads in minute search for a leak in the cables that may occasion
a short circuit later on. The terminals and couplings are buffed and polished
with what seems exaggerated and needless precision&mdash;but this is salvage,
where sustained effort is only possible in the rare and all-too-brief union of
favourable tide and weather conditions. A cessation of the steady throw of the
pumps, however instant and skilful the adjustment, may mean the loss of just
that finite measure in buoyancy that could spring the weight of thousands in
tons. Second chances are rarely given by a grudging and jealous sea; there
must be no hitch in the gear, no halt in weighing the mass.</p>

<p>A drift of lazy smoke on the sea-rim ahead marks our rendezvous, where
<i>Titan</i> and a sisterly tug-boat are already at work on the wreck. A screen of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
motor-patrols are rounding and lining out in the offing, with a thrust of white
foam astern that shows their speed. Coastwise, a convoy of merchant ships
zigzag in confusing angles on their way to sea, guarded by spurring destroyers
and trawler escort. Seaplanes are out, hawking with swoop and wheel for sight
of strange fish. The seascape is busy with a shipping that must remind the
coastguard and lightkeepers of old and palmy days when square sail was standard
at sea. The Westmark Shoal lies some distance from the normal peace-time
track of direct steaming courses. It lies in the bight of a bay, where rarely
steamers closed the land. Sailing ships, close-hauled and working a tack inshore,
or fisher craft on their grounds, had long been the only keels to sheer
water in the deeps, but war practice has renewed our acquaintance with many
old sea-routes and by-paths, and we are back now to charts and courses that
have long been out of our reckoning.</p>

<p>The tide is at low-water slack, and whirls and eddies mark the run over shallows.
At easy speed and handing the lead, we approach the wreck. Her
weathered hull, gilt and red-rusted by exposure to sun and wind and sea, stands
high and bold against the deep blue of a summer sky. Masts and rigging and
cordage are bleached white, like tracery of a phantom ship. The green sea-growth
on her underbody fans and waves in the tide, showing long voyaging in the crust
and stage of it. She lies well and steadily, with only a slight list to seaward that
marks the gradient on which she rests. Through fracture on the stern and counter,
the twisted and shattered frames and beams and angles can be seen plainly.
Sunlight, in slanting rays, shines through the rents and fissures of the upper
deck, and plays on the free flood that washes in and out of the exposed after
hold; seaweed and flotsam surges on the tide, clinging to the jagged, shattered
edges of the plating, and breaking away to lap in the dark recesses. To eyes
that only know the lines and mould of sightly, seaworthy vessels, she seems a
hopeless and distorted mass of standing iron&mdash;a sheer hulk, indeed, fit only for
a lone sea-perch to gull and gannet and cormorant. It appears idle for the salvors
to plan and strive and wrestle for such a prize, but their keen eyes are
focused to values not readily apparent. "A fine ship," says the commander,
now happily assured that his 'soft job' has suffered no worse than a weathering
on the ledge that his skill has secured her. "A job o' work for the repairers,
certainly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but they will set her up as good as new in a third of the time
it would take to build a substitute!"</p>

<span class="caption">A TORPEDOED MERCHANTMAN ON THE SHOALS: SALVAGE OFFICERS MAKING A SURVEY</span>
</div>

<p>We anchor at a length or two to seaward. There is not yet water alongside
for our draught, but <i>Titan</i>, drawing less, is berthed at her stern and their men
are taking advantage of low water to pin and tomp and strengthen the rearmost
bulkhead that must now do duty for the demolished stern section. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
boat from <i>Titan</i> brings the officer in charge, and he greets his senior with no
disguised relief. A serious leak has developed in one of the compartments that
they had counted on for buoyancy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Right under the bilge, and ungetatable,
with all that rubble in th' holds. A good job you brought out these extra
pumps. We should manage now, all right!"</p>

<p>Technical measures are discussed and a plan of operations agreed. At half-flood
there will be water for us alongside, and a 'lift' can be tried. Number
one hold is good and tight, but still has a bulk of water to steady her on the
ledge; number two is clear and buoyant; three has the obstinate leak; the
engine-room is undamaged, but water makes through in moderate quantity.
Number four&mdash;"the bulkhead is bulged in like the bilge of a cask, but that cement
we put down last week has set pretty well, and the struts and braces should hold."
Number five? There is no number five, most of it lies on deep bottom off the
Heads, some miles away!</p>

<p>With his colleague, the commander puts off to the wreck, to assess the prospects,
and we have opportunity to note the inboard trim of her derelict posts
and quarters. Davits, swung outboard as when the last of her crew left her,
stand up in unfamiliar dejection, the frayed ends and bights of the boat-falls
dangling overside and thrumming on the rusty hull. The boat-deck shows
haste and urgency in the litter of spars and tackle thrown violently aside: a
seaman's bag with sodden pitiful rags of apparel lies awry on the skids, marking
some cool and forethinking mariner denied a passage for his goods. Living-rooms
and crew quarters show the indications of sudden call, in open desks&mdash;a
book or two cast side, quick-thrown bedspreads, an array of clothing on a line;
the range-guards in the cook's galley have caught the tilt of pots and mess-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'kids'">kits</ins>
as they slid alee in the grounding. The bridge, with chart and wheelhouse
open to the wind and spray, and sea-gear adrift and disordered, strikes
the most desolating note in the abandon of it all. Tenantless and quiet, the same
scene would be commonplace and understood in dock or harbour, with neighbourly
shore structures to point a reason for absence of ship-life, but out here&mdash;the
clear horizon of an open sea in view around, with vessels passing on their
courses, the desertion of the main post seems final and complete, with no navigator
at the guides and no hand at the wheel.</p>

<p>The flood tide making over the shoals sets in with a <i>thrussh</i> of broken water
alee of the wreck. The salvors' cutter, from which the mate is sounding and
marking bottom, spins in widening circles in the eddies and shows the strength
of early springs. As yet the stream binds the wreck hard to the bank, setting
broad on from seaward, but relief will come when the spent water turns east
on the last of the flood. Survey completed, the salvage officers clamber to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
deck again. The leak in number three is their only concern; if that can be overcome,
there seems no bar to a successful programme. The commander questions
the mate as to the depth of water alongside, is assured of draught, and signals
his vessel to heave up and come on. The strength and onrush of the tidal race
makes the man&oelig;uvre difficult, and it is on second attempt, with a wide sweep
and backing on plane of the current, she drives unhandily to position. The
impact of her boarding, for all the guardian fenders, jars and stirs the wreck,
but brings a confident look to the salvors' faces; as readily shaken as that, they
assure themselves the responding hull will come off with 'a bit of a pinch'
on the angle of withdrawal that they have planned on the tidal chart.</p>

<p>With hawsers and warps barely fast, the great pumps are hove up in air
and swung over the hatchway of the doubtful hold. But for the general order
to carry on, there are few directions and little admonition. Every man of the
busy group of mechanics and riggers has 'a brick for the wall,' and the wriggling
lengths of armoured hose are coupled and launched over the coamings as quickly
as the massive motors are lowered. Foundering with splash and gurgle, like
uncouth sea-monsters in their appanage of tortuous rubber tentacles, the sheen
of their polished bulk looms through the green translucent flood of solid seawater,
the grave and surely augmented tide that they are trimmed to master.
Again, the seeming hopelessness of the task, the handicap of man against element,
presents a doubt to one's mind. Two shell-like casings of steel, a line of
piping and cab-tyre coils for power leads&mdash;to compete with the infiltration of
an ocean; there are even small fish darting in the flood of it, a radiating Medusa
floats in and out the weltering 'tween-decks, waving loathsome feelers as though
in mockery of human efforts!</p>

<p>Like a war-whoop to the onslaught the dynamos of the salvage vessel start
motion, and hum in <i>crescendo</i> to a high tenor tone; the vibrations of their
speed and cycle are joined in conduct to the empty hull of the wreck, and she
quickens with a throb and stir as of her arteries coursing. There is no preparatory
trickle at outboard end of the hose ejections; with a rush and roar, a clean,
solid flood pours over, an uninterrupted cascade at seven tons from each per
minute!</p>

<p>The carpenter sounds the depth with rod and chalked lanyard, then lowers
a tethered float to water-level of the flooded compartment. In this way he
sets a starting mark for the competition, a gauge for the throw of the pumps.
In interest with the issue, the salvage men gather round the hatchway, and all
eyes are turned to the bobbing cork disc to note the progress of the contest.
Stirring and drifting to slack of the line, the float seems serenely indifferent to
its important motion; wayward and buoyant, it trims, this way and that, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
steadies suddenly on a taut restraint; slowly it seems to rise in the water as
though drawn by an invisible hand. It spins a little to lay of the cord, then hangs,
moisture dropping and forming rings on the glassy surface of the well! By
no seeming effort but the pulse-like quiver of the hose, the level falls away. A
bolt-head on the plating shows under water, then tips an upper edge above;
a minute later the round is exposed and drying in a slant of the sun.</p>

<p>The tense regard with which we have scanned the guide-mark gives way
to jest and relief when it is seen that drainage is assured; a facetious mechanic
at the hose-end makes motions as of pulling a bar handle to draw a foaming
glass. "Sop it up, old sport!" says the rigger, patting the pipes. "Sop it up
an' spit! Ol' Neptune ain't arf thusty!"</p>

<p>During our engagement, <i>Titan</i> has not been idle. There remains only an
hour or two of flood tide and much has to be done. Leaving steam-pumps to
cope with the more moderate leakage at the after section, she has hauled forward
on the rising tide on the shoal side of the wreck. At the bows she has
applied suction to the prisoned water in the fore holds, and a new stream pours
overside in foaming ejection. The roar and throb of her power motors adds
further volume and vibration to the rousing treatment by which the nerves of
the stranded hulk seem braced. Stirred by the new life on her, the old ship
may well forget she has no stern and only part a bottom. Already the decks,
gaunt and red-rusted as they are, take on a cheering look of service and animation.
The seamen in the rigging and workmen crowded round the hatchways
might be the dockers boarded for a day's work on the loading, and only the
thunder of the motors and crash of the sluicing torrent remain foreign to a normal
ship-day.</p>

<p>The sun has gone west when the tidal current surging past shows a change
in direction. We throw sightly flotsam overboard and note the drift that
takes the refuse astern. No longer the green slimy plates of the hull show above
water, the tide has lapped their sea-growth and ripples high on a cleaner surface.
With high water approaching we draw near the point of balance in buoyancy,
and the salving tenders tighten up headfasts and stern ropes in readiness for a
slip or drag. The sea-tug that has till now been a quiet partner in operations,
smokes up and backs in astern to pass a hawser to the wreck. She drops away
with a good scope, and lies handy to tow at orders.</p>

<p>Tirelessly, droning and throbbing with insistent monotony, the pumps continue
their labour and draw the weight of water that holds the wreck down. At
number three hold the flood below is no longer a still and placid well. The
penned and mastered water seethes and whirls in impotent fury at the suction
that draws and churns only to expel. Some solid matter, seaweed perhaps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
has drifted to the leak and stems a volume of the incoming water; there seems
a prospect that a single pump may keep the level.</p>

<p>In somewhat tense expectancy, we await a crisis in the operations. There
is a feeling that all these masterly movements should lead to a spectacular
resurrection&mdash;a stir and tremor in the frame of her, reviving sea-throes, a lurch,
a list, a mighty heave, and a staggering relaunch to the deeps.</p>

<p>Precise and businesslike, modern salvage avoids such a flourishing end to
their labours. As skilful surgeons, they object strongly to excitement. Their
frail and tortured sea-patients can rarely stand more than gentle suasion.
As surely as the tide they work by, the factors of weight and displacement and
trim have been figured and calculated.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The commander draws our attention
to a quiet and steady rise in the bows, the knightheads perceptibly edging
nearer to a wisp of standing cloud. Without a jar or surge the wreck becomes a
floating ship; she lists a little, as the towing hawser creaks and strains, and we
draw off gently to seaward.</p>


<h3><br />THE DRY DOCK</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A downpour</span> of steady, insistent rain makes quagmire of the paths on the
dockside, and the half-light of a cheerless early morning gives little guidance to
progress among the raffle of discarded ship-gear that lies about the yard. Stumbling
over shores and stagings, skirting gaunt mounds of damaged plates and
angles, we reach the sea-gate where the ship victims of mine and torpedo are
moored in readiness for treatment in the great sea-hospital. In the uncertain
light and under wet lowering skies, they make a dismal picture. The symmetry
of conventional docking&mdash;ships moored in line and heading in the same direction&mdash;that
is an orderly feature of the harbours, is not possible in the overcrowded
basin. There is need to pack the vessels closely. They lie at awkward angles,
the stern of one overhanging the bows of another. Masts and funnels and deck
erections, upstanding at varied rakes, emphasize the confused berthing and draw
the eye to the condition of the mass of damaged shipping. Not all of the vessels
are shattered hulks. A number are here for hull-cleaning or overhaul, but their
high sides with the rust and barnacles and weedy green scum, make as drab a
feature in the combination as the listed hulls of the cripples.</div>

<span class="caption">A TORPEDOED SHIP IN DRY DOCK</span>
</div>

<p>Though nominally daylight, the arc-lamps of the pier-head still splutter
in wet contacts and spread a sickly glow over the oilskin-clad group of dockmen
and officials gathered to enter the ships. A chill breeze from the sea blows in
and carries reek and cinder of north-country coal to thicken the lash of the rain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
The waft comes from heeling dock tugs that strain at their hawsers, spurring
the muddy tide to froth in their task of moving the helpless vessels in the basin.
The long expanse of flooded dock, brimming to the uppermost ledge, lies open
for their entry; the bruised and shattered stern of a large ship is pointed over
the sill at an awkward angle that marks an absence of steam-power aboard
to control her wayward sheer. The dockmaster, in ill mood with her cantrips,
roars admonition and appeal to the smoking tugs to "lie over t' s'uth'ard and
right her!" By check, and the powerful heave of a shore capstan, she warps in
and straightens to the line of the docks. As she draws on to her berth the high
bows of a second cripple swing over from the tiers, and the tugs back out to
fasten on and drag her to the gate.</p>

<p>With entry of the ships, the glistening pier-head becomes thronged by tidesmen
and their gear; like a drill-yard, with the lusty stamp of the marching
lines of dockmen trailing heavy hawsers and handing check and hauling ropes.
In an hour or so the gangs of the ship-repair section will be ready to 'turn to'
at the new jobs, and the ships must be settled and ready against the wail of
the starting 'buzzer.' Shrill whistle signals, orders and hails add to the stir
of the labourers, and clatter of the warping capstan joins in with ready chorus.
Not least of the medley is the bull roar of the harassed dockmaster, who finds a
need in the press for more than one pair of hands at the reins to guide and halt
his tandem charges.</p>

<p>The ships are marked in company, to settle bow to stern, with no room to
spare, in the length of the dock. Conduct must be ruled in duplicate to exact
the full measure of utility from every foot of space. On the last tide a pair of
sound ships were floated out to service, braced and bound and refitted for further
duty as stout obverse to the 'Sure Shield.' Keel-blocks and beds for the new
patients have been set up and rearranged in the brief interval of occupancy,
and now, quick on the wash of the outgoers, are new cases for the shearing
plate-cutters and the swing of hammers.</p>

<p>Mindful to conserve their precious dry-dock space to the limit of good service,
the repair section select the vessels with rare judgment. It is no haphazard
turn of the wheel that brings an American freighter, shattered in stern section,
to the same operating-table as an east-coast tramp (having her engines in scrap,
boilers fractured, and the frames of her midships blown to sea-bottom). The
combined measure of their length and the similarity of extent in hull damage
has brought them to the one line of blocks. Odd cases, and regular ship-cleaning
and minor repairs may be allotted to single-ship dry docks, but
here, in sea-hospital with a twin-berth, there is a need for parallel treatment.
The two ships must be considered as one, and all efforts be promoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
towards refloating them, when hull repairs are completed, on one opening of the
sea-gate.</p>

<p>In this, strangely, they are assisted by the enemy. True, his accommodation
could well be spared, but it does have an influence on repair procedure. The
exact and uniformly graded proportions of the enemy explosive reproduces a
correspondingly like extent and nature in ship damage. Location and sea-trim
may vary the fractures in proportion to resistance but, with the vessels on the
blocks together, working time may be adjusted to these conditions and a balance
be struck that will further a simultaneous completion.</p>

<p>So the dockmaster ranges his pair on the centre line of the keel-blocks, sets
tight the hawsers that hold them in position, and bars the sea-entry with a massive
caisson. Presently he passes an order to the pumpman, and the power-house
echoes to the easy thrust of his giant engine.</p>

<p>The keel-blocks have been set to meet the general lines of the vessels, with
only a marginal allowance for the contour of damaged plating. To remedy
any error divers, with their gear and escort, are ready on the dockside, and they
go below with first fall in the water-level. The carpenters straggle out from
sheltered corners and bear a hand. Riggers and dockmen have placed the
ships, and it remains for the 'tradesmen' to bed them down and prop against
a list by shores and blocks. They are ill content with the vile weather and
their job in the open, where the rain lashes down pitilessly, soaking their
working clothes. Doubtless they envy the dry divers their suits of proofed
rubber, when they are called on to manhandle the heavy timber shores from the
mud and litter of the dockside and launch them out towards the steel sides of
the settling vessels. There the tide-workers on deck secure them by lanyards,
and the spars hang in even order, sighted on doublings of the plates, ready to
pin the ships on a steady keel when the water drains away.</p>

<p>With the timbers held in place, the carpenters split up to small parties and
stand by to set a further locking strain by prise of block and wedge. The dockmaster
blows a whistle signal at the far end of the basin, and casts up his hand as
though arresting movement; the thrust of the main pump stills, and he swings
his arm. At the sign, the carpenters ram home .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the thunder of their forehammers
on the hardwood wedges rings out in chorus that draws a quavering
echo from the empty, hard-pressed hulls.</p>

<p>Settled and bedded and pinned, the ships are left till the water drains away
and to await the coming of the shipwrights and repairing gangs. The carpenters
shoulder their long-handled top-mauls and scatter to a shelter from the steady,
continuous downpour. Up from the floors with their work completed, the divers
doff their heavy head-gear and sit a while, <i>resting</i> comfortably under the thrash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the same persistent rain. Anon, their awkward garb discarded, they walk
off, striding with a crook at the knees, like farmer folk on ploughed land. The
great pumps now pulsate at full speed, drawing water to their sluices in an
eddying current that spins the flotsam and bares ledge after ledge of the solid
dock masonry. From gaping wounds of the crippled vessels a full tide of seawater
gushes and spurts to join the troubled wash below. The beams and side-planking,
and temporary measures of the salvage section, uncover and come to
sight, showing with what patience and laborious care the divers have striven
to stem an inrush.</p>

<p>On the second ship the receding water-line exposes the damage to her engine-
and boiler-rooms. A litter of coal and oily scum showers from angles of the
wrecked bunker and stokehold to the floor of the dock, and leaves the fractured
beams and tubes to stand out in gaunt twist and deformity. Through the
breaches the shattered cylinders and broken columns of the engines lie distorted
in a piled raffle of wrenched pipe sections, valves and levers, footplates, skeleton
ladders, and shafting. The mass of distorted metal has still a shine and token
of polish, and these signs of late care and attention only serve to make the ruin
seem the more complete and irremediable.</p>

<p>An hour later a strident power syren sounds out from roof of the repair
'shops.' The workmen, hurrying to 'check in' at the gates, scarcely glance
at their new jobs on the blocks of the dry-dock. To them it seems quite a commonplace
that the round of their industry should suffer no halt, that the two
seaworthy ships they completed yesterday should be so quickly replaced by
the same type of casualty for their attention. The magnitude of the task&mdash;the
vast extent of plating to be sheared and rebuilt, the beams to be withdrawn
or straightened in place, the litter to be cleared&mdash;holds no misgivings. Short
on the stroke of 'turn to' they straggle down the dockside to start the round
anew. With critical eye, foremen and surveyors chalk off the cypher of their
verdicts on the rusted displaced remnants; the gangs apportion and assemble
with tools and gear; the huge travelling cranes rumble along on their railways,
and lower slings and hooks in readiness for a load of damaged steel.</p>

<p>With the men lined out to the gangways and filing down the dock steps,
chain linking in trial over the crane sheaves, and the bustle of preparation on
ship and shore, everything seems set for an instant beginning&mdash;but no hammer
falls as yet. There is, first, a sad freight to be discharged; not all the crew of
the ship with the wrecked engines have gone to the pay-table. Three sombre
closed wagons are waiting by the dockside, and towards them down the long
gangways from the ship, the bodies of an engineer and some of the stokehold
crew are being carried. The weltering flood that held them has drained to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
dock, and busy hands have searched in the wreckage where they died at their
post.</p>

<p>We have no flags to honour, no processional march to accompany our dead.
Their poor bodies, dripping and fouled, are draped in a simple coarse shroud
that hardly conceals the line of their mangled limbs. Awkwardly the carriers
stumble on the sodden planking and rest arms and knees on the guiding hand-lines.
The workmen pause on the ship and gangways and look respectfully,
if curiously, at the limp burdens as they are carried by.</p>

<p>Here and there a man speaks of the dead, but the most are silent, with lowering
looks, set teeth&mdash;a sharp intake of the breath.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Who knows? Perhaps
the spirits of the murdered seamen may come by a payment at the hands of the
shipwright gangs. The best monument to their memory will stand as another
keel on the deep&mdash;a quick ripost to the enemy, in his victim repaired and strengthened
and returned to sea.</p>

<p>Lowering looks, set teeth, a hissing intake of the breath are the right accompaniment
to a blow struck hard home; the thunder of hammers and drills, the
hiss and sparkle of shearing cutters, that breaks out when the wagons have gone,
marks a start to their monument!</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<h3>ON CAMOUFLAGE&mdash;AND SHIPS' NAMES</h3>


<div class='cap'>EARLY in the war the rappel of 'Business as usual' was as deadly at sea
as elsewhere. Arrogant and super-confident in our pride of sea-place,
we made little effort to trim and adapt our practice to rapidly altering
conditions; there were few visible signs to disquiet us, we hardly deviated from
our peaceful sea-path, and had no concern for interference. We carried our
lights ablaze, advertised our doings in plain wireless, announced our sailings
and arrivals, and even devoted more than usual attention to keeping our ships
as span in brave new paint and glistening varnish as the hearts of impressionable
passengers could desire.</div>

<p>We had difficulties with our manning. The seamen were off, at first tuck of
drum, to what they reckoned a more active part in the great game of war&mdash;the
strictly Naval Service&mdash;and we were left with weak crews of new and raw hands
to carry on the sea-trade. So, from the very first of it, we engaged in a moral
camouflage in our efforts to keep up appearances, and show the neutrals with
whom we did business that such a thing as war could hardly disturb the smooth
running of our master machine&mdash;the Merchants' Service!</p>

<p>Some there were among us who saw the peril in such prominence, and took
modest (and somewhat hesitating) steps to keep out of the limelight, by setting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
lonely courses on the sea, restraining the comradely gossip of wireless operators,
and toning down appearances from brilliant polish to the more sombre part suiting
a sea in war-time. Deck lights were painted over and obscured, funnel and
masts were allowed to grey to neutral tints, the brown ash that discomposes
fine paint at sea was looked upon with a new and friendly eye. The bias
of chief mates (in a service where promotion is the due for a clean and
tidy ship) was, with difficulty, overcome, and a new era of keen look-out and
sea-trim started.</p>

<p>There was but moderate support for these bold iconoclasts who dared thus to
affront our high fetish. Ship painting and decoration and upkeep were sacrosanct
rites that even masters must conform to; the enactments of the Medes and
Persians were but idle rules, mere by-laws, compared to the formul&aelig; and prescriptions
that governed the tone of our pantry cupboards and the shades of
cunning grain-work. We were peaceful merchantmen; what was the use of
our dressing up like a parish-rigged man-o'-war? As to the lights&mdash;darkening
ship would upset the passengers; there would be rumours and apprehension.
They would travel in less 'nervous' vessels!</p>

<p>The mine that shattered <i>Manchester Commerce</i> stirred the base of our happy
conventions; the cruise of the <i>Emden</i> set it swaying perilously; the torpedoes
that sank <i>Falaba</i> and <i>Lusitania</i> blew the whole sham edifice to the winds, and we
began to think of our ships in other terms than those of freight and passenger
rates. Our conceptions of peaceful merchantmen were not the enemy's!</p>

<p>We set about to make our vessels less conspicuous. Grey! We painted
our hulls and funnels grey. In many colours of grey. The nuances of our coatings
were accidental. Poor quality paint and variable untimely mixings contributed,
but it was mainly by crew troubles (deficiency and incapacity) that we
came by our first camouflage. As needs must, we painted sections at a time&mdash;a
patch here, a plate or two there&mdash;laid on in the way that real sailors would call
'inside-out'! We sported suits of many colours, an infinite variety of shades.
Quite suddenly we realized that grey, in such an ample range&mdash;red-greys, blue-greys,
brown-greys, green-greys&mdash;intermixed on our hulls, gave an excellent
low-visibility colour that blended into the misty northern landscape.</p>

<p>Bolshevik now in our methods, we worked on other schemes to trick the
murderer's eye. Convention again beset our path. The great god Symmetry&mdash;whom
we had worshipped to our undoing&mdash;was torn from his high place. The
glamour of Balances, that we had thought so fine and shipshape, fell from our
eyes, and we saw treachery in every regular disposition. Pairs&mdash;in masts, ventilators,
rails and stanchions, boat-groupings, samson posts, even in the shrouds
and rigging&mdash;were spies to the enemy, and we rearranged and screened and altered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
as best we could, in every way that would serve to give a false indication of
our course and speed. Freighters and colliers (that we had scorned because of
ugly forward rake of mast and funnel) became the leaders of our fashion. We
wedged our masts forward (where we could) and slung a gaff on the fore side of
the foremast; we planked the funnel to look more or less upright; we painted
a curling bow wash over the propellor and a black elaborate stern on the bows.
We trimmed our ships by the head, and flattered ourselves that, Janus-like,
we were heading all ways!</p>

<p>Few, including the enemy, were greatly deceived. At that point where
alterations of apparent course were important&mdash;to put the putting Fritz off his
stroke&mdash;the deck-houses and erections with their beamwise fronts or ends would
be plainly noted, and a true line of course be readily deduced. With all our new
zeal, we stopped short of altering standing structures, but we could paint, and we
made efforts to shield our weakness by varied applications. Our device was old
enough, a return to the chequer of ancient sea-forts and the line of painted gun-ports
with which we used to decorate our clipper sailing ships. (That also was a
camouflage of its day&mdash;an effort to overawe Chinese and Malay pirates by the
painted resemblance to the gun-deck of a frigate.) We saw the eye-disturbing
value of a bold criss-cross, and those of us who had paint to spare made a 'Hobson-jobson'
of awning spars and transverse bulkheads.</p>

<p>These were our sea-efforts&mdash;rude trials effected with great difficulty in the
stress of the new sea-warfare. We could only see ourselves from a surface point
of view, and, in our empirics, we had no official assistance. During our brief
stay in port it was impossible to procure day-labouring gangs&mdash;even the 'gulls'
of the dockside were busy at sea. On a voyage, gun crews and extra look-outs
left few hands of the watch available for experiments; in any case, our rationed
paint covered little more than would keep the rust in check. We were relieved
when new stars of marine coloration arose, competent shore concerns that,
on Government instruction, arrayed us in a novel war paint. Our rough and
amateurish tricks gave way to the ordered schemes of the dockyard; our ships
were armed for us in a protective coat of many colours.</p>

<p>Upon us like an avalanche came this real camouflage. Somewhere behind
it all a genius of pantomimic transformation blazed his rainbow wand and fixed
us. As we came in from sea, dazzle-painters swarmed on us, bespattered creatures
with no bowels of compassion, who painted over our cherished glass and teakwood
and brass port-rims&mdash;the last lingering evidences of our gentility. Hourly
we watched our trim ships take on the hues of a swingman's roundabouts. We
learned of fancy colours known only in high art&mdash;alizarin and grey-pink, purple-lake
and Hooker's green. The designs of our mantling held us in a maze of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
expectation. Bends and ecartel&eacute;s, indents and rayons, gyrony and counter-flory,
appeared on our topsides; curves and arrow-heads were figured on boats
and davits and deck fittings; apparently senseless dabs and patches were
measured and imprinted on funnel curve and rounding of the ventilators; inboard
and outboard we were streaked and crossed and curved.</p>

<p>With our arming of guns there was need for instruction in their service and
maintenance; artificial smoke-screens required that we should be efficient
in their use; our Otters called for some measure of seamanship in adjustment
and control. So far all governmental appliances for our defence relied on our
understanding and operation, but this new protective coloration, held aloof
from our confidence, it was quite self-contained, there was no rule to be learnt;
we were to be shipmates with a new contrivance, to the operation of which we
had no control. For want of point in discussion, we criticized freely. We
surpassed ourselves in adjectival review; we stared in horror and amazement
as each newly bedizened vessel passed down the river. In comparison and simile
we racked memory for text to the gaudy creations. "Water running under a
bridge.".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Forced draught on a woolly sheep's back."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Mural
decoration in a busy butcher's shop."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Strike <i>me</i> a rosy bloody pink!"
said one of the hands, "if this 'ere don't remind me o' jaundice an' malaria an'
a touch o' th' sun, an' me in a perishin' dago 'orspittel!"</p>

<p>While naming the new riot of colour grotesque&mdash;a monstrosity, an outrage,
myopic madness&mdash;we were ready enough to grasp at anything that might help
us in the fight at sea. We scanned our ships from all points and angles to unveil
the hidden imposition. Fervently we hoped that there would be more in it than
met our eye&mdash;that our preposterous livery was not only an effort to make Gargantuan
faces at the Boche! Only the most splendid results could justify our
bewilderment.</p>

<p>Out on the sea we came to a better estimate of the value of our novel war-paint.
In certain lights and positions we seemed to be steering odd courses&mdash;it
was very difficult to tell accurately the line of a vessel's progress. The low
visibility that we seamen had sought was sacrificed to enhance a bold disruption
of perspective. While our efforts at deception, based more or less on a one-colour
scheme of greys, may have rendered our ships less visible against certain
favouring backgrounds of sea and sky, there were other weather conditions
in which we would stand out sharply revealed. Abandoning the effort to cloak
a stealthy sea-passage, our newly constituted Department of Marine Camouflage
decked us out in a bold pattern, skilfully arranged to disrupt our perspective,
and give a false impression of our line of course. With a torpedo travelling to
the limit of its run&mdash;striking anything that may lie in its course, range is of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
little account. Deflection, on the other hand, is everything in the torpedo-man's
problem&mdash;the correct estimation of a point of contact of two rapidly
moving bodies. He relies for a solution on an accurate judgment of his target's
course; it became the business of the dazzle-painters to complicate his working
by a feint in colour and design. The new camouflage has so distorted our sheer
and disrupted the colour in the mass as to make our vessels less easy to hit. If
not invisible against average backgrounds, the dazzlers have done their work
so well that we are at least partially lost in every elongation.</p>

<p>The mystery withheld from us&mdash;the system of our decoration&mdash;has done much
to ease the rigours of our war-time sea-life. In argument and discussion on its
origin and purpose we have found a topic, almost as unfailing in its interest as
the record day's run of the old sailing ships. We are agreed that it is a brave
martial coat we wear, but are divided in our theories of production. How is it
done? By what shrewd system are we controlled that no two ships are quite
alike in their splendour? We know that instructions come from a department
of the Admiralty to the dockyard painters, in many cases by telegraph. Is there
a system of abbreviations, a colourist's shorthand, or are there maritime Heralds
in Whitehall who blazon our arms for the guidance of the rude dockside painters?
It can be worked out in fine and sonorous proportions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='center'>For s.s. <span class="smcap">Corncrix</span></div>

<p><i>Party per pale, a pale; first, gules, a fesse dancette, sable; second, vert, bendy,
lozengy, purpure cottised with nodules of the first; third, sable, three billets bendwise
in fesse, or: sur tout de tout, a barber's pole cockbilled on a sinking gasometer, all
proper.</i> For motto: "<i>Doing them in the eye.</i>"</p></div>

<p>One wonders if our old conservatism, our clinging to the past, shall persist
long after the time of strife has gone; if, in the years when war is a memory
and the time comes to deck our ships in pre-war symmetry and grace of black
hulls and white-painted deck-work and red funnels and all the gallant show of it,
some old masters among us may object to the change.</p>

<p>"Well, have it as you like," they may say. "I was brought up in the good
old-fashioned cubist system o' ship painting&mdash;fine patterns o' reds an' greens
an' Ricketts' blue, an' brandy-ball stripes an' that! None o' your damned newfangled
ideas of one-colour sections for me!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Huh!</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And black hulls,
too!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Black! A funeral outfit!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, sir! I may be wrong, but
anyway, I'm too old now to chop and change about!"</p>

<p>If we have become reconciled to the weird patterns of our war-paint, every
instinct of seafaring that is in us rebels against the new naming of our ships.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Is it but another form of camouflage&mdash;like the loving Indian mother abusing
her dear children for deception of a malicious listening Djinn? <i>War Cowslip</i>,
<i>War Dance</i>, <i>War Dreamer!</i> War Hell! Are our new standard ships being thus
badly named, that the enemy may look upon them as pariahs, unworthy of shell
or torpedo? Perhaps, as a thoughtful war measure, it may be chargeful of
pregnant meaning; our new war names for the ships may be germane to some
distant world movement, the first tender shoot of which we cannot yet recognize!
More than likely, it is the result of the fine war-time frolic of fitting the cubest
of square pegs in the roundest of holes. How is it done? Is there, in the hutments
of St. James's Park, an otherwise estimable and blameless greengrocer,
officially charged with the task of finding names for vessels, 015537-68 inclusive,
presently on the Controller's lists and due to be launched?</p>

<p>We sailors are jealous for our vessels. Abuse us if you will, but have a care
for what you may say of our ships. We alone are entitled to call them bitches,
wet brutes, stubborn craft, but we will stand for no such liberties from the beach;
strikes have occurred on very much less sufficient ground. Ridicule in the naming
of our ships is intolerable. If <i>War</i> is to be the prefix, why cannot our greengrocer
find suitable words in the chronicles of strife? Can there be anything
less martial than the <i>War Rambler</i>, <i>War Linnet</i>, <i>War Titmouse</i>, <i>War Gossamer?</i>
Why not the <i>War Teashop</i>, the <i>War Picture House</i>, the&mdash;the&mdash;the <i>War Lollipop?</i>
Are we rationed in ships' names? Is there a Controller of Marine Nomenclature?
The thing is absurd!</p>

<p>If our controllers had sense they would see the danger in thus flouting our
sentiment; they would value the recruiting agency of a good name; they
would recognize that the naming of a ship should be done with as great care as
that of an heir to an earldom. Is the torpedoed bos'n of the <i>Eumaeus</i> going
to boast of a new post on the <i>War Bandbox?</i>   What are the feelings of the
captain of a <i>Ruritania</i> when he goes to the yards to take over a <i>War Whistler?</i>
Why <i>War?</i>   If sober, businesslike argument be needed, it is confusing; it
introduces a repetition of initial syllable that makes for dangerous tangles in
the scheme of direction and control.</p>

<p>It is all quite unnecessary. There are names and enough. Fine names!
Seamanlike names! Good names! Names that any sailor would be proud
to have on his worsted jersey! Names that he would shout out in the market-place!
Names that the enemy would read as monuments to his infamy! Names
of ships that we knew and loved and stood by to the bitter end.</p>

<h3>FLAGS AND BROTHERHOOD OF THE SEA</h3>

<div class='cap'>UNLIKE the marches of the land, with guard and counterguard, we had no
frontiers on the sea. There were no bounds to the nations and their
continents outside of seven or ten fathoms of blue water. We all travelled
on the one highway that had few by-paths on which trespassers might be prosecuted.
And our highway was no primrose path, swept and garnished and safeguarded;
it had perils enough in gale and tempest, fog, ice, blinding snow,
dark moonless nights, rock and shoal and sandbar. Remote from ordered assistance
in our necessity, we relied on favour of a chance passer-by, on a fallible
sea-wanderer like ourselves. So, for our needs, we formed a sea-bond, an International
Alliance against our common hazards of wind and sea and fire, an
assurance of succour and support in emergency and distress. Out of our hunger
for sea-companionship grew a union that had few rules or written compacts,
and no bounds to action other than the simply humane traditions and customs
of the sea. There were no statutory penalties for infringement of the rules
unwritten; we could not, as true seamen, conceive so black a case. We had no
Articles of our Association, no charters, no covenants; our only documents were
the International Code of Signals and the Rule of the Road at Sea. With
these we were content; we understood faith and a blood-bond as brother
seamen, and we put out on our adventures, stoutly warranted against what
might come.</div>

<p>In the Code of Signals we had a language of our own, more immediate and
attractive than Volap&uuml;k or Esperanto. The dire fate of the builders of the
Tower held no terror for us, for our intercourse was that of sight and recognition,
not of speech. Our code was one of bright colours and bold striking design&mdash;flags
and pendants fluttering pleasantly in the wind or, in calmer weather,
drooping at the halyards with a lift for closer recognition. The symbol of our
masonry was a bold red pendant with two vertical bars of white upon it. We
had fine hoists for hail and farewell; tragic turn of the colours for a serious
emergency, hurried two-flag sets for urgent calls, leisurely symbols of three for
finished periods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>'<i>Can you</i>' required three flags to itself; <i>me</i> or <i>I</i> or <i>it</i> came all within our
range. We told our names and those of our ports by a long charge of four; we
could cross our <i>t's</i> and dot our <i>i's</i> by beckon of a single square. We lowered slowly
and rehoisted ('knuckles to the staff, you young fool!') our National Ensign,
as we would raise our hat ashore. It was all an easy, courteous and graceful mode
of converse, linguistically and grammatically correct, for we had no concern
with accent or composition, taking our polished phrases from the book. It
suited well the great family of the sea, for, were we a Turk of Galatz and you an
Iceland brigantine, we could pass the time of day or tell one another, simply
and intelligibly, the details of our ports and ladings. Distance, within broad
limits, was small hindrance to our gossip; there were few eyes on the round of
the sea, to read into our confidences. We could put a hail ashore, too. Passing
within sight of San Miguel, we could have a message on the home doorsteps on
the morrow, by hoisting our 'numbers'; the naked lightkeeper on the D&aelig;dalus
could tell us of the northern winds by a string of colours thrown out from the upper
gallery.</p>

<p>Good news, bad news, reports, ice, weather, our food-supply, the wages of our
seamen, the whereabouts of pirates and cannibals, the bank rate, high politics
(we had S.L.R. for Nuncio)&mdash;we had them all grouped and classed and ready
for instant reference. Medicine, stocks, the law (G.F.H., King's Bench; these
sharps who never will take a plain seaman's clear word on salvage or the weather,
or the way the fog-whistle was duly and properly sounded!) Figures! We
could measure and weigh and divide and subtract; we could turn your Greek
<i>Daktylas</i> into a Japanese <i>Cho</i> or <i>Tcho</i>, or Turkish <i>Parmaks</i> into the <i>Draas</i>
of Tripoli! Some few world measures had to be appendixed; a <i>Doppelzentner</i>
was Z.N.L. What is a <i>Doppelzentner?</i>  </p>

<span class="caption">AN APPRENTICE IN THE MERCHANTS&#39; SERVICE</span>
</div>

<p>As evidence of our brotherly regard, our peaceful intent, we had few warlike
phrases. True, we had hoists to warn of pirates, and we could beg a loan, by
signal, of powder and cannon-balls&mdash;to supplement our four rusty Snyders,
with which we could defend our property, but there was no group in our
international vocabulary that could read, "I am torpedoing you without
warning!" Seamanlike and simple, we saw only one form of warfare at sea,
and based our signals on that. "Keep courage! I am coming to your
assistance at utmost speed!"&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "I shall stand by during the night!"&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Water
is gaining on me! I am sinking!"&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Boat is approaching
your quarter!" These, and others alike, were our war signals, framed to
meet our ideas of the greatest peril we might encounter in our conflict with
the elements.</p>


<p>Of all this we write in a sad past tense. Our sea-bond is shattered. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
is no longer a brotherhood on the sea. The latest of our recruits has betrayed
us. The old book is useless, for it contains no reading of the German's avowal,
"Come on the deck of my submarine. I am about to submerge!"&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Stand
by, you helpless swine in the boats, while I shell you and scatter your silly blood
and brains!"</p>

<p>No longer will the receipt of a call of distress be the instant signal (whatever
the weather or your own plight) for putting the helm over. We have shut the
book! We are grown hardened and distrustful. S.O.S. may be the fiend
who has just torpedoed a crowded Red Cross, and endeavours by his lying wireless
to lure a Samaritan to the net. A heaving boat, or a lone raft with a staff
and a scrap, may only be closed with fearful caution; they may be magnets
for a minefield.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. still he called aloud, for he was in the track of steamers. And presently
he saw a steamer. She carried no lights, but he described her form,
a darker shape upon the sea and sky, and saw the sparks volley from her funnel.</p>

<p>"He shrieked till his voice broke, but the steamer went on and vanished.
The Irishman was furiously enraged, but it was of no use to be angry. He went
on calling. So did the other four castaways, but their cries were growing fainter
and less frequent.</p>

<p>"Then there loomed another steamer, and she, too, went on. By this time,
perhaps, an hour had gone by, and the Arab firemen had fallen silent. The
Irishman could see them no longer. He never saw them again. A third steamer
hove in sight, and she, too, went on. The Irishman cursed her with the passionate
intensity peculiar to the seaman, and went on calling. It was a desperate
business.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

conning-tower, looked down upon his victims.</p>

<p>"Crouched upon the thwarts in the sunlight, up to their knees in water, which,
stained crimson, was flowing through the shell-holes in the planking, soaked
with blood, holding their wounds, staring with hunted eyes, was the heap of
stricken men.</p>

<p>"The German ordered the boat away. The shore was fifteen miles
distant.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

<p>He ordered the boat away! The shame of it! The abasing, dishonouring
shame of it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Bitterly, tarnished&mdash;we realize our portion in the guilt, our share in this
black infamy&mdash;that seamen should do this thing!</p>

<p>What of the future? What will be the position of the German on the sea
when peace returns, let the settlement by catholic conclave be what it may?</p>

<p>Sailorfolk have long memories! Living a life apart from their land-fellows,
they have but scant regard for the round of events that, on the shore, would be
canvassed and discussed, consented&mdash;and forgotten. There is no busy competing
commercial intrigue, no fickle market, no grudging dalliance on the sea.
We stand fast to our own old sea-justice; we have no shades of mercy or condonation,
no degrees of tolerance for this bastard betrayer of our unwritten
sea-laws. No brotherhood of the sea can be conceived to which he may be re-admitted.
Not even the dethronement of the Hohenzollern can purge the deeds
of his marine Satraps, for their crimes are individual and personal and
professional.</p>

<p>In the League of Nations a purged and democratic Germany may have a
station, but there is no redemption for a Judas on the sea. There, by every
nation, every seafarer, he will remain a shunned and abhorred Ishmael for all
time.</p>

<h3>THE CONVOY SYSTEM</h3>


<div class='cap'>EARLY in 1917 the losses of the merchants' ships and men had assumed a
proportion that called for a radical revision of the systems of naval
protection. Concentrating their energies on but one specific form of sea
offence, the enemy had developed their submarine arm to a high point of
efficiency. Speed and power and lengthy sea-keeping qualities were
attained. To all intents and purposes the U-boats had become surface
destroyers with the added conveniency of being able to disappear at
sight. They conducted their operations at long distance from the land
and from their bases. The immense areas of the high seas offered a
peculiar facility for 'cut-and-run' tactics: the system of independent
sailings of the merchantmen provided them with a succession of victims,
timed in a progression that allowed of solitary disposal.
Notwithstanding the matured experience of submarine methods gained by
masters, the rapid evolution of counter-measures by the Royal Navy, the
courage and determination of all classes of seafarers, our shipping and
that of our Allies and the neutral nations was being destroyed at a rate
that foreshadowed disaster.</div>

<p>Schemes of rapid ship construction were advanced, lavish expenditure
incurred, plans and occupation designed&mdash;all to ensure a replacement of
tonnage at a future date. More material in point of prompt effect were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
efforts of the newly formed Ministry of Shipping to conserve existing tonnage
by judicious and closely controlled employment. All but sternly necessary
sea-traffic was eliminated: harbour work in loading and unloading was
expedited: the virtues of a single control enhanced the active agency of the
merchants' ships&mdash;now devoted wholly to State service. Joined to the provisional
and economic measures of the bureaux, Admiralty reorganized their
methods of patrol and sea-supervision of the ships. The entry of the United
States into the world war provided a considerable increase of naval strength to
the Allied fleets. Convoy measures, that before had been deemed impracticable,
were now possible. Destroyers and sloops could be released from fleet duties
and were available as escorts. American flotillas crossed the Atlantic to protect
the sea-routes: Japanese war craft assisted us in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In the adoption of the convoy system the Royal Navy was embarking on
no new venture. Modern ships and weapons may have brought a novel complication
to this old form of sea-guardianship, but there is little in seafaring
for which the traditions of the Naval Service cannot offer text and precedent.
The constant of protection by convoy has remained unaltered by the advance
of armament and the evolution of strange <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'warcraft'">war craft</ins>: the high spirit of self-sacrifice
is unchanged. When, in October 1917, the destroyers <i>Strongbow</i>
and <i>Mary Rose</i> accepted action and faced three German cruisers, their commanders&mdash;undismayed
by the tremendous odds&mdash;reacted the parts of the common
sea-dramas of the Napoleonic wars. The same obstinate courage and unconquerable
sea-pride forbade them to desert their convoy of merchantmen and seek
the safety that their speed could offer. H.M.S. <i>Calgarian</i>, torpedoed and sinking,
had yet thought for the convoy she escorted. Her last official signal directed
the ships to turn away from the danger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>
<img src="images/i-198.jpg" width="600" height="410" alt="BUILDING A STANDARD SHIP" title="" />
<span class="caption">BUILDING A STANDARD SHIP</span>
</div>

<p>The convoy system did not spring fully served and equipped from the earlier
and less exacting control. Tentative measures had to be devised and approved,
a large staff to be recruited and trained. The clerical work of administration
was not confined to the home ports; similar adjustment and preparation had
to be conducted in friendly ports abroad. As naval services were adapted to
the new control, the system was extended. The comparatively simple procedure
of sending destroyer escorts to meet homeward-bound convoys became involved
with the timing and dispatch of a mercantile fleet sailing from a home port. The
escorts were ordered out on a time-table that admitted of little derangement. Sailing
from a British port with a convoy of outward-bound vessels, the destroyers
accompanied that fleet to a point in the Atlantic. There the convoy was dispersed,
and the destroyers swung off to rendezvous with a similar convoy of inward-bound
vessels. While the outgoing merchantmen were allowed to proceed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
independently after passing through the most dangerous area, the homeward-bound
vessels were grouped to sail in company from their port abroad. An
ocean escort was provided&mdash;usually a cruiser of the older class&mdash;and there was
opportunity in the longer voyage for the senior officer to drill the convoy to
some unity and precision in man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>The commander of the ocean escort had no easy task in keeping his charges
together. The age-old difficulty of grouping the ships in the order of their
sailing (now steaming) powers has not diminished since Lord Cochrane, in command
of H.M.S. <i>Speedy</i>, complained of the 'fourteen sail of merchantmen' he
convoyed from Cagliari to Leghorn. In the first enthusiasm of a new routine,
masters were over-sanguine in estimation of the speed of their ships. The
average of former passages offered a misleading guide. While it was possible
to average ten and a half knots on a voyage from Cardiff to the Plate, proceeding
at a speed that varied with the weather (and the coal), station could not easily
be kept in a ten-knot convoy when&mdash;at the cleaning of the fires&mdash;the steam went
'back.' Swinging to the other extreme (after experience of the guide-ship's
angry signals), we erred in reserving a margin that retarded the full efficiency
of a convoy. Our commodores had no small difficulty in conforming to the date
of their convoy's arrival at a rendezvous. The 'cruising speed' of ten knots,
that we had so blithely taken up when sailing from an oversea port, frequently
toned down to an average of eight&mdash;with all the consequent derangement of
the destroyers' programme at the home end; a declared nine-knot convoy
would romp home at ten, to find no escort at the rendezvous.</p>

<p>In time, we adjusted our estimate to meet the new demands. Efforts of the
Ministry of Shipping to evolve an order in our voyaging that would reduce
irregularities had good results. The skilfully thought-out appointment of
the ships to suitable routes and trades had effect in producing a homogeneity
that furthered the employment of our resources to the full. The whole conduct
of our seafaring speedily came within the range of governmental control, as
affecting the timely dispatch and arrival of the convoys. The quality of our
fuel, the state of the hull, competence of seamen, formed subject for close investigation.
The rate of loading or discharge, the urgency of repairs and refitment,
were no longer judged on the note of our single needs; like the states of the
weather and the tide, they were weighed and assessed in the formula that
governed our new fleet movements.</p>

<p>The system of convoy protection had instant effect in curbing the activities
of the U-boats. They could no longer work at sea on the lines that had proved
so safe for them and disastrous for us. To get at the ships they had now to
come within range of the destroyers' armament. Hydrophones and depth-charges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
reduced their vantage of submersion. The risks of sudden rupture of
their plating by the swiftly moving keel of an escorting vessel did not tend to
facilitate the working of their torpedo problem. In the coastal areas aircraft
patrolled overhead the convoys, to add their hawk-sight to the ready swerve
of the destroyers. The chances of successful attack diminished as the hazard
of discovery and destruction increased. Still, they were no fainthearts. The
German submarine commanders, brutal and hell-nurtured, are no cowards.
The temptation of a massed target attracted them, and they sought, in the
confusion of the startled ships, a means of escape from the destroyers when
their shot into the 'brown' had run true.</p>

<p>Convoy has added many new duties to the sum of our activities when at
sea. Signals have assumed an importance in the navigation. The flutter of a
single flag may set us off on a new course at any minute of the day. Failure to
read a hoist correctly may result in instant collision with a sister ship. We
have need of all eyes on the bridge to keep apace with the orders of the commodore.
In station-keeping we are brought to the practice of a branch of
seamanship with which not many of us were familiar. Steaming independently,
we had only one order for the engineer when we had dropped the pilot. 'Full
speed ahead,' we said, and rang a triple jangle of the telegraph to let the engineer
on watch know that there would be no more 'backing and filling'&mdash;and that he
could now nip into the stokehold to see to the state of the fires. Gone&mdash;our
easy ways! We have now to keep close watch on the guide-ship and fret the
engineer to adjustments of the speed that keep him permanently at the levers.
The fires may clag and grey down through unskilful stoking&mdash;the steam go
'back' without warning: ever and on, he has to jump to the gaping mouth of
the voice-tube: "Whit? Two revolutions? Ach! Ah cannae gi' her ony
mair!"&mdash;but he does. Slowly perhaps, but surely, as he coaxes steam from the
errant stokers, we draw ahead and regain our place in the line. No small measure
of the success of convoy is built up in the engine-rooms of our mercantile fleets.</p>

<p>Steaming in formation at night without lights adds to our 'grey heires.'
The menace of collision is ever present. Frequently, in the darkness, we have
no guide-ship in plain sight to regulate our progress. The adjustments of speed,
that in the daytime kept us moderately well in station, cannot be made. It is
best to turn steadily to the average revolutions of a former period, and keep
a good look-out for the broken water of a sister ship. On occasion there is the
exciting medley of encountering a convoy bound the opposite way. In the
confusion of wide dispersal and independent alterations of course to avert
collision, there is latitude for the most extraordinary situations. An incident
in the Mediterranean deserves imperishable record: "We left Malta, going east,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and that night it was inky dark and we ran clean through a west-bound convoy.
How there wasn't an accident, God only knows. We had to go full astern to
clear one ship. She afterwards sidled up alongside of us and steamed east for
an hour and a half. Then she hailed us through a megaphone: 'Steamer ahoy!
Hallo! Where are you bound to?' 'Salonika,' we said. 'God Almighty,'
he says. 'I'm bound to Gibraltar. Where the hell's <i>my</i> convoy?'"</p>

<h3>OUTWARD BOUND</h3>

<div class='cap'>CUSTOMS clerks--may their name be blessed--are worth much more than
their mere weight in gold. We do not mean the civil servants at the
Custom House, who listen somewhat boredly to our solemn Oath and
Compearance. Doubtless they, too, are of value, but our concern is with the
owner's shipping clerk who attends our hesitating footsteps in the walk of ships'
business when we come on shore. He greets us on arrival from overseas, bearing
our precious letters and the news of the firm: he has the devious paths of our
entry-day's course mapped out, down to the train we may catch for home. As
an oracle of the port, there is nothing he does not know: the trains, the week's
bill at the 'Olympeambra,' the quickest and cheapest way to send packages to
Backanford, suitable lodging in an outport, the standing of the ship laundries,
the merits of the hotels--he has information about them all. During our stay
in port he attends to our legal business. He speeds us off to the sea again,
with all our many folios in order.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>In peace, we had a settled round that embraced the Custom House for entry,
the Board of Trade for crew affairs, the Notary for 'Protest.' (".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
experienced the usual heavy weather!") War has added to our visiting-list.
We must make acquaintance with the many naval authorities who control our
movements; the Consuls of the countries we propose to visit must see us in
person; it would be discourteous to set sail without a p.p.c. on the Dam-ship
and Otter officers. Ever and on, a new bureau is licensed to put a finger in our
pie: we spend the hours of sailing-day in a round of call and counter-call. The
Consul wishes to <i>vis&eacute;</i> our Articles&mdash;the Articles may not be handed over till we
produce a slip from the Consul, the Consul will grant no slip till we have seen the
S.I.O. "Have we identity papers for every member of the crew, with photograph
duly authenticated?"&mdash;"We are instructed not to grant passports!" Back and
forward we trudge while the customs clerk at our side tells cheerfully of the
very much more trying time that fell to Captain Blank.</p>

<p>By wile and industry and pertinacity he unwinds the tangle of our longshore
connections. He reconciles the enmity of the bureaux, pleads for us,
apologizes for us, fights for us, engages for us. All we have to do is to sign,
and look as though the commercial world stood still, awaiting the grant of that
particular certificate. Undoubtedly the customs clerk is worth his weight in
red, red gold!</p>

<p>On a bright summer afternoon we emerge from the Custom House. We have
completed the round. In the case which the clerk carries we have authority to
proceed on our lawful occasions. Customs have granted clearance; our manifests
are stamped and ordered; the Articles of Agreement and the ship's Register
are in our hands. The health of our port of departure is guaranteed by an
imposing document. Undocking permit, vouchers for pilotage and light dues,
discharge books, sea-brief, passports, and store-sheets, are all there for lawful
scrutiny. In personal safe-keeping, we have our sea-route ordered and planned.
The hard work is done. There is no more <i>business</i>&mdash;nothing to do but to go on
board and await the rise of tide that shall float us through the river channels to
sea.</p>

<p>Cargo is stowed and completed; the stevedores are unrigging their gear
when we reach the ship. Our coming is noted, and the hatch foremen (in
anticipation of a 'blessing') rouse the dockside echoes with carefully phrased
orders to their gangs: "T' hell wit' yes, now! Didn't Oi tell ye, Danny Kilgallen,
that <i>th' Cyaptin</i> wants thim tarpolyan sames turned fore an' aff!"
(A shilling or two for him!)&mdash;"Beggin' yer pardon, sir&mdash;I don't see th' mate
about&mdash;will we put them fenders below <i>for ye</i> before we close th' hatch?"
(Another <i>pourboire!</i>  )&mdash;Number three has finished his hatchway, but his smiling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
regard calls for suitable acknowledgment. (After all, we shall have no use for
British small coinage out West!) The head foreman, dear old John, is less
ambitious. All he wants is our understanding that he has stowed her tight&mdash;and
a shake of the hand for good luck. Firmly we believe in the good luck that
lies in the hand of an old friend. "'Bye, John!"</p>

<p>In groups, as their work is finished, the dockers go on shore, and leave to the
crew the nowise easy task of clearing up the raffle, lashing down, and getting
the lumbered decks in something approaching sea-trim. Fortunately, there
is time for preparation. Usually, we are dragged to the dock gates with the
hatches uncovered, the derricks aloft, and the stowers still busy blocking off
the last slings of the cargo. This time there will be no hurried (and improper)
finish&mdash;the stevedores hurling their gear ashore at the last minute, slipping down
the fender lanyards, scurrying to a 'pier-head jump,' with the ship moving
through the lock! Some happy chance has brought completion within an hour
or two of tide-time. The mate has opportunity to clear ship effectively, and
we have leisure to plot and plan our sea-route (in anticipation of hasty chart
glances when we get outside) before the pier-master hails us&mdash;"Coom along wi'
t' <i>Massilia!</i>  "</p>

<span class="caption">DROPPING THE PILOT</span>
</div>
<p>Tugs drag us through the inner gates, pinch and angle our heavy hull in the
basin, and enter us into the locks. The massive gates are swung across, the
sluices at the river-end eased to an outflow and, slowly, the great lock drains
to the river level. The wires of our quay-fasts tauten and ring out to the tension
of the outdraft, as we surge in the pent water-space and drop with the falling
level. Our high bridge view over the docks and the river is pared in inches by
our gradual descent; the deck falls away under cope of the rough masonry;
our outlook is turned upwards to where the dockmaster signals his orders. The
ship seems suddenly to assume the proportions of a canal-boat in her contrast
with the sea-scarred granite walls and the bulk of the towering gates.</p>

<p>At level with the flood, the piermen heave the outer lock-gates open for our
passage. We back out into the river, bring up, then come ahead, canting to
a rudder pressure that sheers us into the fairway. The river is thronged by
vessels at anchor or under way, docking and undocking on the top of the tide,
and their man&oelig;uvres make work for our pilot. At easy speed we work a traverse
through the press at the dock entrances and head out to seaward.</p>



<p>Evening is drawing on as we enter the sea-channels&mdash;a quiet close to a fine
summer day. Out on the estuary it is hard to think of war at sea. Shrimpers
are drifting up on the tide, the vivid glow of their tanned canvas standing over
a mirrored reflection in the flood. The deep of the fairway is scored by passage
of coasting steamers, an unending procession that joins lightship to lightship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in a chain of transport. The sea-reaches look in no way different from the
peaceful channels we have known so long, the buoys and the beacons we pass
in our courses seem absurdly tranquil, as though lacking any knowledge that
they are signposts to a newly treacherous sea. Only from the land may one
draw a note of warning&mdash;on shore there are visible signs of warfare. The searchlights
of the forts, wheeling over the surface of the channels, turn on us and
steady for a time in inspection. Farther inland, ghostly shafts and lances are
sweeping overhead, in ceaseless scrutiny of the quiet sky.</p>

<p>At a bend in the fairway we close and speak the channel patrol steamer and
draw no disquieting impression from her answer to our hail. The port is still
open and we may proceed on our passage to join convoy at &mdash;&mdash;. An escort
will meet us in 1235 and conduct us to 5678. 'Carry on!'</p>

<p>It is quite dark when we round the outer buoy and reduce speed to drop our
pilot. The night is windless and a calm sea gives promise of a good passage.
We bring up close to the cutter, and, shortly, with a stout 'Good-bye,' the pilot
swings overside and clambers down the long side-ladder to his boat. We shut
off all lights and steer into the protecting gloom of the night.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<h3>RENDEZVOUS</h3>

<div class='cap'>ALMOST hourly they round the Point, turning in from seaward with a fine
swing and thrash of propellors to steer a careful course through the boom
defences. Screaming gulls wheel and poise and dive around them, exulting
to welcome the new-comers in, and the musical clank and rattle of anchor
cables, as the ships bring up in the Roads, mark emphatic periods to this--the
short coasting section of the voyage.</div>

<p>"Safe here!" sing the chains, as they link out over the open hawse. "Thus
far, anyway, in spite of fog and coast danger, of mine and submarine," and the
brown hill-side joins echo to the clamour of the wheeling gulls, letting all know
the ships have come in to join the convoy.</p>

<p>The bay, that but a day ago lay broad and silent and empty, now seems to
narrow its proportions as each high-sided merchantman comes in; the hills
draw nearer with every broad hull that anchors, wind-rode, in the blue of the bay.
As if in key with the illusion, the broad expanse of shallow, inshore water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
that before gave distance to the hills, now sheds its power, cut and furrowed as it
becomes by thrash and wake of tugs and launches all making out to serve the
larger vessels.</p>

<p>On the high mound of the harbour-master's look-out, keen eyes note all
movements in the bay. The signal-mast and yard bear a gay setting of flags
and symbols, and rapid changes and successions show the yeoman of signals
and his mates at work, recording and replying, taking mark and tally of the ships
as they arrive. Up and down goes the red-and-white-barred answering pendant
to say that it is duly noted&mdash;"<i>War Trident</i>, <i>Marmion</i>, and <i>Pearl Shell</i> report
arrival"&mdash;or the semaphore arms, swinging smartly, tell H.M.S. <i>03xyz</i> that
permission to enter harbour (she having safely escorted the trio to port) is
approved.</p>

<p>Out near the entrance to the bay, where the 'gateships' of the boom defences
show clear water, the patrol steamer of the Examination Service lays-to,
challenging each incoming vessel to state her name and particulars. These, in
turn, are signalled to the shore and the yeoman writes: "Begins war trident
for norfolk va. speed nine knots is ready for sea stop marmion for Bahia
reports steering engine broken down will require ten hours complete repairs
stop pearl shell nine and half short-handed one fireman two trimmers report
agents stop ends."</p>

<p>If room is scanty, the convoy office has at least an atmosphere in keeping
with its mission. Nestling close under the steep brow of the harbour-master's
look-out, it was, in happier days, the life-boat coxswain's dwelling, and a constant
reminder of sea-menace and emergency almost blocks the door&mdash;the long boat-house
and launch-ways of the life-boat. Four square and solid, the little house
only has windows overlooking the bay, as if attending strictly to affairs at sea
and having no eyes for landward doings; the peering eaves face straight out
towards the 'gateships' as though even the stone and lime were intent on the
sailing of the convoys, whose order and formation are arranged within their
walls. The upper room has a desk or two, a telephone, a chart table, and a
typewriter, and here the port convoy officer and his assistants trim and index
and arrange the ships in order of their sailing. At the window a seaman-writer
is typing out 'pictures' for the next sailing&mdash;signal tables, formation and
dispersal diagrams, call signs, zigzags, constantly impressing that Greenwich
Mean Time is the thing (no Summer Time at sea), and that courses are True,
<i>not</i> Magnetic. The clack and release of his machine seem quite a part of conversation
between the convoy officer and his lieutenant; the whole is so apparently
disjointed in references to this ship and that, to repairs and tides, and
shortage of 'hands' and water-supply and turns in the hawse, and even Spanish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
influenza! To one accustomed to single-ship work the whole is mildly bewildering,
and one readily understands that sailing a merchant convoy calls for more
than the simple word of command.</p>

<p>"<i>War Trident</i>, nine knots," reads the junior, from a signal slip. "<i>Marmion</i>, a
doubtful starter&mdash;steering-gear disabled. <i>Pearl Shell</i>, three stokehold hands short."</p>

<p>"<i>Trident</i> only nine! That be damned for a yarn!" says his senior, reaching
for the slip. "Nine will reduce the speed of the whole convoy a knot. She must
be good for more&mdash;new ship, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes. One of these new standards&mdash;built for eleven knots and chocked up
afterwards with fancy gear and 'gadjets' to rob the boilers."</p>

<p>"Lemme see&mdash;nine knots"&mdash;turning to the pages of a tide-book, the convoy
officer makes a rough sum of it. "High water at Oysterpool&mdash;so&mdash;arrived here&mdash;distance&mdash;and
seventy-one. Why, he's come on from Oysterpool at ten, no
less, and that's not allowing for the zigzag either!"</p>

<p>The lieutenant looks round for his cap. Clearly there is a definite 'drill'
for captains who come on from Oysterpool at ten and declare their speed as
nine, and he is ready when the P.C.O. passes orders. "All right. You
go off and see the captain. Try to get him to spring at least half a knot.
I expect he's allowing a bit for 'coming up,' and going easy till he knows his
new ship.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'll 'phone <i>Pearl Shell's</i> agents and warn 'em to hustle round for
firemen. <i>Marmion?</i> Yes. Board <i>Marmion</i> on your way back. Wants ten
hours&mdash;she should be able to keep her sailing." A year agone there would
have been but moderate and passive interest in the varying troubles of the ships
and their crews, but much water has flowed over the Red Ensign since then,
and we are learning.</p>

<p>The convoy lieutenant goes down a winding path to the boat-slip and boards
his launch to set off for the Roads. The morning, that broke fair and unclouded,
has turned grey; a damp sea-mist is wandering over the bay in thin wraiths and
feathers, but sunlight on the brown of the distant hills promises a clearing as
the day draws on. Fishing-smacks, delayed by want of wind, are creeping in
to the market steps under sweep of their long oars, and their lazy canvas rustles,
and the booms and sheet-blocks creak as the wash of the picket-launch sets
them swaying. In from the sea channels, with their sweeps still wet and glistening,
come the <i>Agnes Whitwell</i>, <i>Fortuna</i>, the <i>Dieudonn&eacute;</i>, and <i>Brother Fred</i>,
each with a White Ensign aloft and a naked grey gun on their high bows. They
are late in their return, and one can guess at deadly iron spheres stirred from
the depths of the fairways, thrown buoyant in the wash astern, and destroyed
by crack of gunfire. The commodore of the sisterly pairs, a young lieutenant
of Reserve, waves a cheery greeting as we pass.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>And now the Roads, windless and misty, the anchored merchantmen swung
at different angles, in their gay fantasy of dazzle-paint, borrowing further motley
from the mist, and leering grotesquely through the thin vapours. But for her
lines, undeniably fine and graceful, <i>War Trident</i> is the standardest of standards.
Dazzle-painters have slapped their spite at her in lurid swathes and, not content,
have draped her sheer in harlequin crenellations. Her low pipe-funnel upstands
in rigid perpendicular. ("Chief! Pit yer haun' up an' feel if th' kettle's
bilin'!") No masts break the long length of her, saving only a midship signal-pole
that serves her wireless aerials and affords a hod-like perch for the look-out
aloft. She is stark new, smooth of plating, and showing even the hammer-strokes
on her rivets. Through the thin paint on her sides, marks and symbols
of construction appear, the letters of her strakes painted in firm white, with
here and there an unofficial shipyard embellishment&mdash;"Good old Jeemy Quin,"
or "Tae hell wi' the Kiser!" She is ready for sea, and life-boats and davits,
swung outboard, tower overhead as the picket-launch draws up at her gaunt
side. She is in ballast trim, and it is evident that her standard carpenters hold
strictly to a rule that ignores a varying freeboard&mdash;the side ladder is short by
eight feet, and only by middling the rungs (a leap at the bottom, a long swaying
climb, and a drag at the top) are we able to clamber on board.</p>

<p>A special 'drill' for conducting affairs with masters of brand-new ships
should be devised immediately by Admiralty, and the mildest of Low-Church
curates (trimmed by previous dire tortures to the utter limit of
exasperation) be provided, on whom officials may be well practised. Usually
the master has been hurried out of port by the last rivet driven home, with
strange officers and the very weakest of new crews, in a ship jam-full of the newest
'gadjets,' and the least possible reserve of gear to work them. Quickly and
bitterly the fourth sentence of Confession at Morning Prayer is recalled to him&mdash;the
things undone crowd round, and there is nothing in the bare hull to serve as a
makeshift. The engines and <i>auxiliaries</i> (that, with a builder's man at every
bearing, worked well on trials) now develop tricks and turns to keep the chief
engineer and his fledgling juniors on the run; the mate cries "Kamerad" to
all suggestions, pointing to his hopeless watch of one. (Eight deck: four in
a watch, less one helmsman and two look-outs, equals one.) Add to the sum of
difficulties that the captain has probably been ashore since he lost his last ship,
and finds the new tactics and signals and zigzags unfamiliar; through it all
the want of familiar little trifles and fixings (that go so far to help a ready action),
sustains a feeling of irritation.</p>

<p>It is little wonder that the convoy lieutenant goes warily, and, indeed, but
for the brilliant inspiration of using the 'last ship,' it seems probable that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
convoy will have to proceed at <i>Trident's</i> modest nine knots. Bluntly, the
captain is in undisguised ill-humour. He has been on deck practically since
leaving the builder's yard, and his weary eyes suggest a need for prompt sleep.
His room, still reeking of new paint and varnish, is in some disorder, and
shows traces of an anxious passage along the coast. 'Notices to Mariners'
lie open at the minefield sketches, with a half-smoked pipe atop to keep the
pages open; chart upon chart is piled (for want of a rack) on bed and couch;
oilskins, crumpled as when drawn off, hang over the edge of a door&mdash;not a peg
to hang them on; an open sextant case, jammed secure by pillows, lies on the
washstand lid; books of sailing directions, a taffrail log, some red socket-flares,
are heaped awry in a corner of the room; the whole an evidence that lockers
and minor ship conveniences are not yet standardized. Pray goodness he may
have a stout honest thief of a chief mate, able and willing to find a baulk or
two of timber, and a few nails and brass screws and copper tacks and a curtain-rod
or two and a bolt of canvas!</p>

<p>The convoy lieutenant, unheeding a somewhat surly return of his greeting,
produces Convoy Form No. AX, and starts in cheerfully to fill the vacant columns.
"Tonnage, captain?&mdash;register will do. Crew? Guns? Coal?&mdash;consumpt.
at speeds. Revolutions per half-knot?" The form completed, he hands it
over for signature, thus tactfully drawing the captain's attention to the secretarial
work he has done for him. "What's the speed? Nine and a half?"
"Speed!" answers the Old Man. "Hell! This bunch of hair-springs can't
keep out of her own way! Speed? The damned funnel's so low we can't get
draught to burn a cigarette-paper; and these new pumps they've given her!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Well, we might do nine, but only in fine weather, mind you. Nine knots!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to do better for this convoy, captain. There's not a ship under
nine and a half; but there may be a bunch of eight-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'knoters'">knotters</ins> going out in five
days."</p>

<p>"Nothing under nine and a half! What? Why, there's <i>Pearl Shell</i> came
in with us. She hasn't a kick above nine. When I was in the old <i>Collonia</i>,
we.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"The <i>Collonia?</i>   A fine ship, Gad! Were you in her, captain, when she
was strafed? Let's see&mdash;Mediterranean, wasn't it?" The captain nods
pleasantly, as if accepting a compliment.</p>

<p>"<i>Umm!</i> Mediterranean&mdash;troops&mdash;a hell of a job to get them off. Lost
some, though"&mdash;regretfully.</p>

<p>The convoy lieutenant turns a good card. "Must be a change to come down
to ten knots, captain, after a crack ship like <i>Collonia</i>. What could she do?
Sixteen?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh no. We could get an eighteen-knot clip out of her&mdash;more, if we
wanted!" (If <i>War Trident's</i> speed be low and doubtful, the Old Man can
safely pile the knots on his stricken favourite.) "<i>She</i> was a ship, not a damned
parish-rigged barge like this&mdash;a poverty-stricken hulk that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Yes. I heard about her from Benson, of <i>War Trumpet</i>. He sailed in last
convoy. Said he was glad he wasn't appointed here."</p>

<p>"Wasn't appointed here, be damned! Didn't have the chance. Why,
that ship of his isn't in the same class at all. The <i>Trident</i> can steer, anyway,
and when we get things fixed up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She has the hull of a fine ship. If only we
could get a decent funnel on her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here, I'll try her at your nine and a half
knots! I'll bet <i>War Trumpet</i> can't do a kick above nine!"</p>

<p>Be it noted that the convoy officers have the wavy gold lace of the R.N.R.
for their rank stripes; plain half-inch ones of the Royal Navy might have had
to let the convoy sail at nine, after all&mdash;not knowing the 'grip' of the 'last
ship.'</p>

<h3>CONFERENCE</h3>

<div class='cap'>"A &nbsp; LAUNCH will be sent off at 3 p.m., S.T., to bring masters on shore
for conference. You are requested to bring"--etc. So reads the notice,
and p.m. finds the coxswain of the convoy office picket-boat steaming
and backing from ship to ship, and making no secret of his disapproval of a scheme
of things that keeps him waiting (tootling, perhaps, an impatient blast), while
leisurely shipmasters give final orders to their mates at the gangways. ("That
damned ship's cat in the chart-room again, sir!")</div>

<p>More ships have come in since the clearing of the morning mist, and calm
weather and vagaries of the tide have combined to crowd the ships in the
anchorage into uncomfortably close quarters; perhaps, after all, it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
be rather the counter-swing of that River Plate boat, anchoring close
abeam ("Given me a foul berth, damn him!"), than the insanitary ways of the
ship's cat that kept the captain, one leg over the rail, so long in talk with
his mate.</p>

<p>Never, since the days of sailing ships and the leisurely deep-sea parliaments
in the ship-chandler's back room, have we been brought so much together.
The bustle and dispatch of steamer work, in pre-war days, kept us apart from
our sea-fellows; there were few forgatherings where we could exchange views
and experiences and abuse 'square-heads' and damn the Board of Trade.
Now, the run of German torpedoes has banded us together again, and in convoy
and their conferences, we are coming to know one another as never before. At
first we were rather reserved, shy perhaps, and diffident, one to another. Careless,
in a way, of longshore criticism and opinion, we were somewhat concerned that
conduct among our peers should be dignified and seaworthy; then, the fine
shades of precedence&mdash;largely a matter of the relative speeds of our commands&mdash;had
to average out before the 'master' of an east-coast tramp and the 'captain'
of an R.M.S. found joint and proper equality. In this again, the enemy
torpedo served a turn, and we are not now surprised to learn that the 'captain'
of a modest nine-knot freighter had been (till she went down with the colours
apeak) 'master' of His Majesty's Transport of 16,000 tons.</p>

<p>So we crowd up together in the convoy launch, and introduce ourselves,
and talk a while of our ships and crews till stoppage of the engines and clatter
of hardwood side-ladders mark another recruit, sprawling his way down the high
wall-side of a ballasted ship. The coxswain sighs relief as he pockets his list&mdash;the
names all now ticked off in order of their boarding&mdash;and puts his helm over
to swing inshore. "A job o' work," he says. "Like 'unt th' slipper, this
'ere! 'Ow can I tell wot ships they is, names all painted hover; an' them as
does show their names is only damn numbers!"</p>

<p>In pairs, colloguing as we go, we mount the jetty steps and find a way to
the conference-room. We make a varied gathering. Some few are in their company's
service uniform, but most of us, misliking an array but grudgingly
tolerated in naval company, wear longshore clothes and, in our style, affect
soft felt hats and rainproof overcoats. Not very gallant raiment, it is true,
but since brave tall hats and plain brass buttons and fancy waistcoats and
Wellingtons went out with the lowering of the last single topsail, we have had
no convention in our attire. In conference we come by better looks&mdash;bareheaded,
and in stout blue serge, we sit a-row facing the blackboard on which our 'drills'
are chalked. Many find a need for eyeglasses, the better to read the small
typescript (uniformly bad) handed round to us, that sets forth our stations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and the order of our sailing, and one wonders if the new look-out has brought
us at last to the hands of the opticians; certainly, our eyes are 'giving' under
the strain.</p>

<p>Of all the novel routine that war has brought to seafaring, convoy work is,
perhaps, the most apart from our normal practice. We have now to think of
concerted action, outboard the limits of our own bulwark; we have become subject
to restriction in our sailing; we conform to movements whose purpose may not,
perhaps, be plainly apparent. Trained and accustomed to single and undisputed
command, it was not easy to alter the habits of a lifetime at sea. We
were autocrats in our small sea-world, bound only by our owner's instruction
to proceed with prudence and dispatch. We had no super-captain on the sea
to rule our lines and set our courses and define our speeds. We made 'eight
bells!'</p>

<p>But the 'bells' we made and the courses we steered and the rate we sped
could not bring all of us safely to port. They gave us guns&mdash;and we used them
passing well&mdash;but guns could not, at that date, deflect torpedoes, and ships
went down. Then came convoy and its success, and we had to pocket our declarations
of independence, and steer in fleets and company; and gladly enough,
too, we availed ourselves of a union in strength, though it took time to custom
us to a new order at sea.</p>

<p>At first we were resentful of what, ill-judging, we deemed interference. Were
we not master mariners, skilled seamen, able to trim and handle our ships in
any state or case? And if, on our side, the great new machine revolved a turn
or two uneasily, it is true that the naval spur-wheel was not itself entirely free
of grit. The naval officers, who drilled us down, were at first distant and superior;
masters were a class, forgotten since sail went out, who had now no prototype
in His Majesty's Service; there was no guide to the standard of association.
Having little, if any, knowledge of merchant-ship practice, naval officers expected
the same many-handed efficiency as in their own service. Crew troubles were
practically unknown in their experience; all coal was 'Best Welsh Navigation';
all ships, whatever their lading, turned, under helm, apace! Gradually we
learned&mdash;as they did. We saw, in practice, that team work and not individual
smartness was what counted in convoy; that, be our understanding of a signal as
definite and clear as the loom of the Craig, it was imperative, for our own safety,
that the reading of out-wing and more distant ships should be as ready and
accurate. In this, our convoy education, the chief among our teachers were the
commodores, R.N. and R.N.R., who came to sea with us, blest, by a happy star,
with <span class="smcap">Tact</span>!</p>

<img src="images/i-220.jpg" width="500" height="343" alt="A CONVOY CONFERENCE" title="" />
<span class="caption">A CONVOY CONFERENCE</span>
</div>

<p>So, we learned, and now sit to listen, attentively and with respect, to what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the King's Harbour Master has to say about our due and timely movements in
forming up in convoy. On him, also, the happy star has shone, and we are conscious
of an undernote that admits we are all good men and true and know our
work. One among us, a junior by his looks, dissents on a movement, and not
all-friendly eyes we turn on him; but he is right, all the same, and the point
he raises is worthy the discussion that clears it. Our ranks are evidence of a
world-wide league of seafarers against German brutality. While his frightfulness
has barred the enemy for ever from sea-brotherhood, it has had effect
in banding the world's seamen in a closer union. We are not alone belligerents
devising measures of warfare; in our international gathering we represent a
greater movement than a council of arms. British in majority, with Americans,
Frenchmen, a Japanese, a Brazilian&mdash;we are at war and ruling our conduct
to the sea-menace, but among us there are neutrals come to join our convoy;
peaceful seamen seeking a place with us in fair trade on the free seas. Two
Scandinavian masters and a Spaniard listen with intent preoccupation to the
lecture&mdash;a recital in English, familiar to them as the Esperanto of the sea.</p>

<p>The K.H.M.'s careful and detailed routine has a significance not entirely
connected with our sailing of the morrow; in a way it impresses one with the
extent of our sea-empire. Most of us have taken station as he orders, have all
the man&oelig;uvres by rote, but even at this late date, there are those among us,
called from distant seas, to whom the instructions are novel. For them, we say,
the emphasis on clearing hawse overnight, the definition of G.M.T., the exactitude
of zigzag, and the necessity of ready answer to signals. We are old stagers
now, <i>we</i> know all these drills, <i>we</i>&mdash; Damn! We, too, are becoming superior!
In turn, the commodore who is to sail with us has his say. Signals and look-out,
the cables of our distance, wireless calls, action guns and smoke-screen, the rubbish-heap,
darkening ship, fog-buoys and hydroplanes, he deals with in a fine,
confident, deep sea-voice. Only on question of the hearing of sound-signals
in fog do we throw our weight about, and we make reminiscent tangents not wholly
connected with the point at issue. Yarn-spinners, courteously recalled from their
digressions, wind up somewhat lamely, and commodore goes on to deal with late
encounters with the enemy in which a chink in our armour was bared. Methods
approved to meet such emergencies are explained, and his part is closed by attention
to orders detailed for convoy dispersal. The commander of the destroyer
escort has a few words for us; a brief detail of the power of his under-water
armament, a request for a 'fair field in action.' Conference comes to an end
when the shipping intelligence officer has explained his routes and given us our
sailing orders.</p>

<p>Till now we have been actually an hour and a half without smoking, and our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
need is great. As one man we fumble for pipes and tobacco (a few lordly East-Indiamen
flaunt cheroots), and in the fumes and at our ease arrange, in unofficial
ways, the small brotherly measures that may help us at sea.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, <i>Chelmsford</i>, you're my next ahead. Well, say, old man, if it comes
fog, give me your brightest cargo 'cluster' to shine astern&mdash;daytime, too&mdash;found
it a good&mdash;&mdash;" "Fog, egad! What about fog when we are forming up?
Looked none too clear t' the south'ard as we came ashore!"</p>

<p>Somewhat late, we realize that not a great deal has been said about weather
conditions for the start-off. The port convoy officer is still about, but all he can
offer is a pious hope and the promise that he will have tugs on hand to help us
out. "No use 'making almanacks' till the time comes," says our Nestor (a
stout old greybeard who has been twice torpedoed). "We shall snake into
column all right, and, anyhow, we're all bound the same way!" "What about
towing one another out?" suggests a junior, and, the matter having been brought
to jest, we leave it at that.</p>

<p>The caretaker jangles his keys and, collecting our 'pictures,' we go out
to the quayside, where thin rain and a mist shroud the harbour basin, and the dock
warehouses loom up like tall clippers under sail. The coxswain comes, clamping
in heavy sea-boots and an oilskin, to tell that the launch is at the steps, ready to
take us off. Two of us have business to conclude with our agent, and remain
on the jetty to see our fellows crowd into shelter of the hood and the launch back
out. We call cheerfully, one to another, that we shall meet at Bahia or New
York or Calcutta or Miramichi, and the mist takes them.</p>

<p>Up the ancient cobbled street we come on an old church and, the rain increasing
to a torrent, we shelter at the porch. Who knows, curiosity perhaps,
urges us farther and we step quietly down-level to the old stone-flagged nave.
The light is failing, and the tombs and monuments are dim and austere, the inscriptions
faint and difficult to read. A line of Drakes lie buried here, and tablets
to the memory of old sea-captains (whose bones may lie where tide is) are on the
walls. A sculptured medallion of ships on the sea draws our attention and we
read, with difficulty, for the stone is old and the lines faint and worn.</p>

<h3>THE SAILING</h3>


<h3><br />FOG, AND THE TURN OF THE TIDE</h3>

<div class='cap'>RAINY weather overnight has turned to fog, and the lighthouse on the
Point greets breaking dawn with raucous half-minute bellows. Less
regular and insistent, comes a jangle of anchor-bells, breaking in from time
to time, ship after ship repeating, then subsiding a while until the syren of a moving
tugboat&mdash;as if giving time and chorus to the din&mdash;sounds a blast, and sets the
look-outs on the anchored ships to their clangour again. From the open sea
distant reedy notes tell that the minesweeping flotilla is out and at work, clearing
the course for draught of the out-bound convoy, and searching the misty sea-channels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>for all the enemy may have moored there. The 'gateships' of the boom
defences rasp out jarring discords to warn mariners of their bobbling floats and
nets. Inshore the one sustained and solemn toll of bell at the pier-head measures
out time to the sum of a dismal dayspring.</div>

<p>By all the sound of it, it is ill weather for the sailing of a convoy. In time
of peace there would not be a keel moving within harbour limits through such a
pall. "Call me when the weather clears," would be the easy order, and we
would turn the more cosily to blanket-bay, while the anchor-watch would pace
athwart overhead, in good content, to await the raising of the curtain. Still
and all, it is yet early to assess the rigour of the fog. Sound-signals, started
late in the coming of it, became routine and mechanical, and persist&mdash;through
clearing&mdash;till their need is more than over. The half-light of breaking day
has still to brighten and diffuse; who knows; perhaps, after all, this
may be only that dear and fond premise of hopeful sailormen&mdash;the pride o'
the morning!</p>

<p>The elder fishermen (the lads are out after the mines) have no such optimism.
Roused by the habits of half a century, they turn out for a pipe and, from window
and doorway, assure one another that their idle 'stand-by' decreed by harbour-master
for outgoing of the convoy, is little hardship on a morning like this.
"'Ark t' them bells," they say, thumb over shoulder. "All 'ung up. Thick
as an 'edge out there, an' no room t' back an' fill. There won't be no move
i' th' Bay till 'arf-ebb, my oath!"</p>

<p>But they are wrong in that, if right in their estimation of the weather and
congestion in the roads, for we are at war, and the port convoy officer, hurrying
to his launch, is already sniffing for the bearings of the leader of the line. Prudently
he has mapped their berths as they came in to anchor, and has, at least, a
serviceable, if rough, chart to guide him on his rounds.</p>

<span class="caption">CONVOY SAILING FROM PLYMOUTH SOUND</span>
</div>

<p>So far there are no reports from the sea-patrols that would call for an instant
alteration of the routes, and for that the P.C.O. has a thankful heart. A 'hurrah's
nest,' a panic on Exchange, a block at the Bank crossing, would be feeble
comparison to the confusion he might look for in a combination of dense fog,
counter-mandates, and a congested roadstead, for, even now, the ships to form
up the next convoy are thrashing their way down the coast and (Article XVI
of the Rule of the Road being lightly held by in war-time) may be expected off
the 'gateships' before long. To them, as yet, the port is 'closed,' but every
distant wail from seaward sets him anxiously wondering whether it be a minesweeper
signalling a turn to his twin or a distant deep-waterman, early on the
tide, standing in for the land. The sailor's morning litany&mdash;"Who wouldn't
sell a farm and go to sea"&mdash;is near to him as he turns up the collar of his oilskin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and gives a rough course to his coxswain. "South, s'west, and ease her when
you hear th' Bell buoy. <i>British Standard</i> first&mdash;she's lying close south of it."
Turning out, the picket-boat sets her bows to the grey wall of mist and her wash and
roundel of the screws (that on a clear busy day would scarce be noted) sound
loud and important in the silence of the bay. The coxswain, cunning tidesman,
steers a good course and reduces speed with the first toll of the buoy. The
clamour of its iron tongue seems out of all relation to the calm sea and the cause
is soon revealed. Silently, closely in line ahead, four grey destroyers break
the mist, fleet swiftly across the arc of vision ahead, and disappear. "Near
it," says the coxswain (and now sounds a blast of <i>his</i> whistle). "Them fellers
ain't 'arf goin' it!" Cautiously he rounds the buoy, noting the gaslight crown
shining yet, though pale and sickly in the growing day. Out now, in seven
fathoms, the lingering inshore fog has given place to a mist, through which the
ships loom up in sombre grey silhouette. Full speed for a turn or two brings
the launch abeam of a huge oil-tanker that, sharp to the tick of Greenwich
Mean Time, already has her Convoy Distinguishing Flags hoisted and the windlass
panting white steam to raise anchor. A small flag in the rigging assures the
P.C.O. that the pilots have boarded in good time, and it is with somewhat of
growing satisfaction that he hails the bridge and asks the captain to 'carry
on!'</p>

<p>Doubts and hesitancies that may have lingered in the prudent captain's
mind are dispelled by the P.C.O.'s appearance. "It is decided, then, that the
orders stand," and there is at least a certain relief in his tone as he orders, "Weigh
anchor!"</p>

<p>The <i>British Standard</i> is deep-loaded, in contrast to the usual empty war-time
outward bound, but her lading is clean salt water, no less, run into her
compartments on the sound theory that Fritz, by a strafe, may only 'change the
water in the tanks.' Homeward, from the west, there will be no such fine assurance,
for a torpedo may well set her ablaze from stem to stern, and the enemy
takes keen and peculiar delight in such <i>Schrecklichkeit</i>. Still, there is little thought
to that; <i>British Standard</i> is to lead the line, and her anchor comes to the hawse
and she backs, then comes ahead again, swinging slowly under helm towards
the sound of 'gateships'' hand-horns. High on the stern emplacement her
men are uncovering her gun and clearing the ranges, and the long grey barrel is
trained out to what will be the sun-glare side of the first tangent of her sea-course.
Close astern of her comes <i>War Ordnance</i>, her pushful young captain having taken
heed of the sounds of <i>Standard's</i> weighing. "Good work," says the P.C.O.
cheerfully, and cons his rough chart for the whereabouts of Number Three.</p>

<p>As though the devil in the wind had heard him, down comes the fog again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
dense this time, a thick blanket-curtain of it that shuts off the misty stage on
which the prompter had hoped, passably, to complete his dispatch of the fleet.</p>

<p>The compass again. "East 'll do," and the launch slips through the grey
of it. All around in the roadstead the clank of cable linking over the spurs,
and hiss and thrust of power windlasses are indication that <i>British Standard's</i>
movement has given signal to weigh, that it is plain to the others&mdash;"Convoy
will proceed in execution of previous orders." A propellor, thrashing awash
in trial, looms up through the fog ahead, but 'East' has brought the launch
wide of her mark, and <i>Massilia</i> is answer to the P.C.O.'s hail. <i>Massilia</i> is
Number Four, but needs must when the fog drives, so he advises the captain
to get under way and head out.</p>

<p>Number Three has stalled badly and is hot in a burst of graceless profanity
from bridge to forecastle-head, and (increasing in volume and blood-red emphasis)
from there to the chain-locker. There is a foul stow. Her nip-cheese
builders have pared the locker-space to the mathematical limit (to swell her
carrying tonnage), and the small crew that her nip-cheese owners have put on
her are unable to range the tiers. Twenty fathoms of chain remain yet under
water, the locker is jammed, and the mate, roughed (and through a megaphone,
too), from the bridge, is calling on strange deities to take note that, 'of all the
damn ships he ever sailed in.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.' The pilot calls out from the bridge
that they are going to pay out and restow, and the convoy officer, blessing the
forethought that had bade him send off Number Four, swings off to speed the
succession.</p>

<p>High water has made and the tide ebbs, swinging the ships yet anchored
till they head inshore, and adding to the pilots' worry of narrowed vision the need
to turn short round in crowded waters. For this the tugs have been sent out in
readiness, and the convoy launch has a busy mission in casting about to find
and set them to the task of towing the laggards round. It is nothing easy,
in the fog and confusion of moving ships, to back the <i>Seahorse</i> in and harness
her by warp and hawser, but with every vessel, canted, that straightens to her
course, the press is lightened by so much sea-room cleared. Gradually the hail
and counter-hail, hoarse order and repeat, whistle-signals, protest of straining
tow-ropes, die away with the lessening note of each sea-going propeller.</p>

<p>To Number Three again, last of the line and out of her station, the convoy
officer seeks to return. The fog is denser than ever, and the echoes of the bay,
now transferred to seaward, augment the uneasy short-blast mutterings where
the ships, closed up at the narrow 'gateway,' are slowing and backing to drop
their pilots. In his traverse of the anchorage the coxswain has lost bearing of
the <i>Cinderella</i> and steers a zigzag course through the murk. The sun has risen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
brightening the overhead but proving (in sea glare and misty daze) an ally
to the veil. No sound of heaving cable or thunder of escaping steam that would
mark a vessel hurrying to get her anchor and make up for time lost is to be heard.
Frankly puzzled, the coxswain stops his engines. "Must 'a sailed, sir," he says
at length. "There ain't nothin' movin' this end o' th' bay."</p>

<p>The convoy officer nods. "<i>Mmm!</i> She may have gone on, while we were
dragging <i>Marmion</i> clear of th' stern of that 'blue funnel' boat. A good job.
Well, carry on! Head in&mdash;think that was th' pier-head bell we heard abeam!"</p>

<p>At easy speed the launch turns and coxswain bends to peer at the swinging
compass-card. As one who has held out to a job o' work completed, the P.C.O.
stretches his arms and yawns audibly and whole-hearted. "A good bath now
and a bite o' breakfast and&mdash; Oh, hell! What's that astern?"</p>

<p>The turn in the wake has drawn his eye to a grey blur in the glare of the
mist. An anchored ship!</p>

<p>Keeping the helm over, the coxswain swings a wide circle and steadies on
the mark. "Damn if it ain't her!" he says, as the launch draws on.</p>

<p>The <i>Cinderella</i> lies quiet with easy harbour smoke rising straight up from
her funnel and no windlass party grouped on the forecastle-head; quiet, as if fog
and convoy and the distant reverberations of her sister ships held no concern
for her. To the P.C.O.'s surprised and somewhat indignant hail there is returned
a short-phrased assurance that the ruddy anchor is down&mdash;and is going to remain
down! "Think I'm going out in this to hunt my place in the pack? No damn
fear!" says the captain. "Why, I can scarce see who's hailing me, less a line
o' ships barging along!"</p>

<p>The pilot, in a tone that suggests he has already 'put out an oar'&mdash;with
little effect&mdash;joins in to reassure. "Clearin' outside now, captain. I haven't
heard th' lighthouse syren for twenty minutes or more! The fog'll be hangin'
here in harbour a bit."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye! But it's here we are, pilot&mdash;not outside yet. A clearing out
there doesn't show us th' leading marks, and I'll not risk it. I've no fancy for
nosing into th' nets and booms. I know where I am here, and I won't stir a
turn&mdash;unless"&mdash;bending over the light screen towards the launch&mdash;"unless
you lead ahead!"</p>

<p>The convoy officer is somewhat embarrassed. Certainly the weather is as
thick as a hedge; there is no 'drill' of convoy practice that empowers him
to order risks to be taken&mdash;navigation of the ships is not his province. It is
enough for him to arrange and advise and assist. If he leads out and anything
<i>does</i> happen?</p>

<p>Still, it is maddening to think of one hitch in a good programme&mdash;'almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
a record, too!' He looks at his watch and notes that only fifty minutes have
elapsed since <i>British Standard</i> weighed.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell! Right, captain," he says. "Heave up and I'll give you a lead
out to clear weather!"</p>


<h3><br />'IN EXECUTION OF PREVIOUS ORDERS'</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">We</span> are Number Four in the line; <i>Vick&mdash;beer&mdash;code</i> is our address, and
we steam somewhat faster than the fog warrants to keep touch with our
next ahead. She, in turn, is packing close up on the leader, and if, in the
strict ruling of a 'line ahead,' we are stepping out a trifle wide, at least
we keep in company. The farthest we can see is the thrash of foam, white
in the grey, of <i>War Ordnance's</i> propeller&mdash;a good moving mark, that, though
faint, draws the eye by the lead of broken water. Nearer, we have a steering-guide
in her hydroplane, cutting and dancing under the bows and throwing a
sightly feather of spray. The sea is flat calm, save for our leader's wake&mdash;a
broad ribbon of troubled water through which we steer. Our eyes, now limited
in range by the fog, seem to focus readily on trifles; for want of major objects,
roving glances take in driftwood and ship-litter, and turn on minute patches of
seaweed with an interest that a wider range would dissipate. Spurring, black-crested
puffins come at us from under the misty pall, floating still, as if set in
glass, till our bow wash plays out and sets them, squawking in distress, to an
ungainly splutter on the surface, or dipping swiftly to show white under-feathers
and the widening rings of their dive.</div>

<p>Astern of us, a medley of sound and steering-signals marks the gateway of
the harbour where our followers are striving to drop their pilots and join in
convoy; one loud trumpeter is drawing up at speed and showing, by the frequency
of her whistle-blasts, anxiety to sight our wake. The lighthouse syren
roars a warning of shoal-water out on the landward beam, a raucous discord
of two weird notes. These, with the rare mournful wail of our leader, are our
guiding sounds, but we have sight now and then of the destroyer escort passing
and turning mistily on the rim of our narrowed vision, like swift sheep-dogs
folding the stragglers of a scattered flock.</p>

<p>The fog, that settled dense and deep as we got under way, shows a little
sign and promise of thinning, a small portent that draws our eyes to the lift
above the funnel. There is no wind, but our smoke-wrack, after curving with
our speed to masthead height, seems turned by light upper draughts to the eastward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
The sun has risen and peers mistily over the top of the grey curtain
that surrounds us. The day is warming up. Pray fortune, a stout west wind
may come out of it all, to clear the muck and give us one good honest look at
one another, when we are due for that 'six-point' turn to the south'ard!</p>

<p>To keep in station on our pacemaker, we call for constant alterations in the
speed&mdash;a range of revolutions that rattles up scale and down, like first lessons
on the piano, and sets the engineers below to a plaintive verge of tears. The
junior officer at the voice-pipe looks reflective, after each order he passes, as
though comparing the quality of the reply with the last sulphurous rejoinder.
The fog has added to our starting vagaries and postponed a happy understanding,
but we shall do better later on when we have gauged and discovered&mdash;and pitied&mdash;the
tiresome vacillations of the <i>other</i> ships!</p>

<p>Meantime, as best we can, we chase the sheering hydroplane ahead that seems
endowed with every chameleon gift of the classic gods. It vanishes, invisible,
in a drift of fog, and though we con a course as steady as a cat on eggs, a clearing
comes to show us its white feather broad on the bows and edging off at an angle
to dip under the thick of the mist! It drops down to us; we sheer aside and
slow a pace, and it lingers and dallies sportively abeam. It slips suddenly ahead,
with a rush and a rip, as though, like a child among the daisies, it recalls a parent
in advance.</p>

<p>The trumpeter astern has come up and sighted our wake and fog-buoy, and
the clamour of her questing syren is stilled. She looms up close on our quarter,
a huge menacing bulk of sheering steel with the foam thundering under her
bows and curling and shattering on her grey hull. <i>They</i> have great difficulty
in adjusting to our speed. She slows and fades back into the mist, grows again
from gloomy shadow to threatening detail, steadies at a point for a few minutes,
and resumes the round of her previous motions in irritating cycle. "Whatever
can be the matter with them?" (We take the stout point of a position as steady
as the Rock, and grow scornful of their clumsy efforts to keep station.) "<i>Huh!</i>
These gold-laced London men! Why can't they steady up a bit? Why can't
they&mdash;&mdash;" We note that our steering-mark and the wash of <i>War Ordnance's</i>
propeller are no longer in sight ahead, and set in to count the beats of the
screw. ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. t'-one, t'-two, t'-three, t'&mdash; <i>Hell!</i> Didn't we order seventy?
Go full speed!" Jumping to the tube, the junior attends. "<i>I</i> said seven-owe,
sir, but he thought I said six-four! Says th' bl&mdash;, th' engines working, sir&mdash;can't
hear properly!"</p>

<p>Grudgingly, as though loath to give us our sight again, the fog clears. The
first of the tantalizing rift in the curtain is signalled by the high look-out, who
calls that he can see the topmasts of our near neighbours piercing the low-lying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
vapours. The sun shines through, showing now and then a clear-cut limb in
place of the luminous misshapen brightening that has been with us since sunrise.
In fits and starts the fog thins, and thickens again, at the will of wandering airs.</p>

<p>A west wind comes away, freshens, and stirs the vapour till it whips close
overhead in wraiths and streamers, raises here and there a fold on the distant
horizon, then dies again. Growing in vigour, the breeze returns; a gallant
breath that ruffles the smooth of the sea and sweeps the round of it, routing
the lingering flurries that settle, dust-like, when the mass is cleared.</p>

<p>The clearing of our outlook produces a curious confusion to the eye. We have
become accustomed to a limited range in sight, and the sudden change to distant
vision, in which there is no standard of position, no mark to judge by, effects
an illusion as of a photographer's plate developing. Fragments, wisps, and
sections of the sea-rim appear, breaking through as the fog lifts, and seeming
strangely high and foreign in position. Topmasts and a funnel-wreath of black
smoke loom up almost in mid-air; the water-line of a ship's hull grows to sight,
low in the plane as though dangerously close. Distant, obscure, and blurred
formations sharpen suddenly to detail and show our destroyer escort as almost
suspended in mirage, floating in air. Piece by piece, the plate develops in sensible
gradation, fitting and joining with exactitude; the ships ahead take up their
true proportions, the sea-horizon runs to a definite hard line. Mast and funnel
and spar stand out against the piled and shattered fog-bank, whose rear-guard
lingers, sinking but slowly and sullenly, on the rim of the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>The fog cleared, and a busy seascape in sight, we shake ourselves together
and take heed of appearances. Our convoy signal hangs damp and twisted
on the halyards, and needs to be cleared to blow out for recognition; the mirrored
arc-lamp that we turned astern to aid the trumpeter is switched out. With the
fog-buoy we are less urgent; it will be time enough to haul it aboard when we
are assured the new-born breeze is healthy and likely to remain with us. The
press of work about the decks has lessened with the hawsers and docking gear
stowed away. Sea-trim is the order now&mdash;a war sea-trim, in which the boats,
swung outboard and ready for instant use, rafts tilted to a launching angle,
hoses rigged to lead water, and crew at the guns, form a constant reminder
(if that be needed) of lurking under-water peril. In marked contrast to less
exciting days, when we could afford to disregard whatever might go on behind
us, we place look-outs to face all ways. The enemy may gamble on our occupation
with the view ahead, but, with a new war wariness, we have grown eyes
to search the sea astern.</p>

<p>In the clearing weather we become sensitive to the strict and proper reading
of our sailing orders. There must be no more faults in the voice-tube to let us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
down from confidence in our right to a sudden sense of guilt. We adjust our
station in the line by sextant angles of the leader, measuring his height to fractions,
and set an ear to the note of our engine-beats to ensure a steady gait.</p>

<p>Clearing our motes, we turn a purged and critical eye on our fellows, now all
clear of the mist, and steaming in sight. To far astern, where the land lies and
the sun plays on wet roof and flashing window-pane, a long line of ships snakes
out in procession, their smoke blowing and curling merrily alee to join the cumulus
of the foundering fog-banks. There are gaps and kinks in our formation
that would, perhaps, call for angry signals in a line of battle, but the laggards
are closing up in hasty order to right the wayward tricks of sound and distance
in the fog. If not quite ruled and ordered to figures of our text, at least we
conform to the spirit, and are all at sea together, steering out on our ventures.</p>

<p>Our distance run, <i>British Standard</i> puts her helm over and turns out. Forewarned,
all eyes have been focused on the line of her masts, and her sheer gives
signal for a general cut and shuffle. We change partners. Curtsying to full
rudder pressure, we join the dance, and swing to her measure, adjusting speed
to mark time while other important leaders of columns draw up abeam. The
flat bright sea is cut and curved by thrashing wakes as the convoy turns south.
Ahead and abeam, round and about, the destroyers wheel and turn, fan in
graceful formation and swerve quickly on their patrolling courses.</p>

<p>We are less expert in the figures of our cotillion. It cannot be pretended
that we slip into our convoy stations with anything approaching their speed
and precision. We are too varied in our types, in turning periods, in the range
of our dead-weight, to man&oelig;uvre alike. Most of us have but a slender margin
of speed to draw on, and, 'all bound the same way,' the spurt to an assigned
position proves the stern a long chase. The fog, at starting, has thrown many
of us out of our proper turn, and we zigzag, unofficially, this way and that,
to gain our stations without reduction of speed. In the confusion to our surface
eyes, there is this consoling thought&mdash;that the same perplexing evolutions
(calling for frequent appeals to the high gods for enlightenment as to the 'capers'
of the <i>other</i> fellows) have, at least, no better meaning in the reflected angles of
a periscope.</p>

<p>Now the hum and drone that has puzzled us in the fog reveals itself as the
note of a covey of seaplanes searching the waters ahead. They have come out
at first sign of a clearing, and now fly low, trimming and banking in their flight
like gannets at the fishing. A winking electric helio on one of them spits out a
message to the leader of the destroyers, and she flashes answer and acknowledgment
as readily as though the seaplane were a sister craft. A huge coastal airship
thunders out across the land to join our forces. She grows to the eye as though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
expanding visibly, and noses down to almost masthead height in a sharp and
steady-governed decline; abeam, she turns broad on, man&oelig;uvring with ease
and grace, and the sunlight on her silvered sides glints and sparkles purely,
as though to shame the motley camouflage of the ships below.</p>

<p>The commodore poises the baton as his ship draws up to her station. Till
now we have steamed and steered 'in execution of previous orders' and, considering
the dense fog and the press of ships at the anchorage and pilot-grounds,
we have not been idle or neglectful. Now we are in sea order, and, with the ships
closing up in formation, we attend our senior officer's signals as to course and
speed. A string of flags goes up, fluttering to the yard of his ship, and we fret
at the clumsy fingers that cannot get a similar hoist as quickly to ours. Anon,
on all the ships, a gay setting of flags repeats the message, and we stand by to
take measure and sheer of a tricky zigzag, at tap of the baton.</p>

<p>The line of colour droops and fades quickly to the signalman's gathering;
the convoy turns and swings into the silver-foil of the sun-ray.</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>

<h3>THE NORTH RIVER</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE broad surface of the Hudson is scored by passage of craft of all trades
and industries. Tugs and barges crowd the waterway in unending
succession, threading their courses in a maze of harbour traffic; high-sided
ferry-boats surge out from their slips and angle across the tide&mdash;crab-wise&mdash;towards
the New Jersey shore; laden ocean steamers hold to the deeps of the
fairway on their passage to the sea. Up stream and down, back and across,
sheering in to the piers and wharves, the harbour traffic seems constantly to be
scourged and hurried by the lash of an unseen taskmaster. The swift outrunning
current adds a movement to the busy plying of the small craft&mdash;a
hastening sweep to their progress, that suggests a driving power below
the yellow tide. The stir of it! The thrash of screw and lapping of discoloured
water, the shriek of impatient whistle-blasts, the thunder of escaping
steam!</div>

<p>As we approach from seaward, there is need for caution. The railway tugmen&mdash;who
live by claims for damages from ocean steamers&mdash;are alert and determined
that we shall not pass without a suitable parting of their hawsers, damage
to barges, strain to engines and towing appliances. Off the Battery, they sidle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to us in coy appeal, but we carry bare steerageway. As the pilot says: "Thar
ain't nothin' doin'!" We disengage their ardent approach, and make a slow
progress against the tide to our loading-berth. There, we drop in towards the
pier-head and angle our bows alongside the guarding fenders. A flotilla of panting
tugboats takes up station on our inshore side and 'punches' into us&mdash;head
on&mdash;to shove our stern round against the full pressure of the strong ebb tide.
The little vessels seem absurdly small for their task. They 'gittagoin',' as
instructed by the pilot, and wake the dockside echoes with the strain of their
energy. White steam spurts from the exhausts with every thrust of their power.
The ferry-boats turning in to their slips come through the run of a combined
stern wash that sets them on the boarding with a heavy impact. Power tells.
Our stern wavers, then we commence to bear up-stream in a perceptible measure.
The Hudson throws a curl of eddying water to bar our progress, but we pass
up&mdash;marking our progress by the water-side of the west shore. Anon, the
thunder of the tugs' pulsations eases, then stops: they back away, turn, and
speed off on a quest for other employment&mdash;while we move ahead, out of the
run of the tide, and make fast at the pier.</p>

<p>Our ship is keenly in demand. The dockers are there, ready with gear and
tackle to board and commence work. The wharf superintendent hails us from
the dockside before the warps are fast. He is anxious to know the amount of
ballast coal to be shifted from the holds before he can commence loading. "Toosday
morning, capt'n," he adds, as reason for his anxiety&mdash;"Toosday morning&mdash;an'
she's gotta go!" Tuesday, eh! And this is Saturday morning! They
will have to hustle to do it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>
<img src="images/i-238.jpg" width="600" height="426" alt="A TRANSPORT LOADING" title="" />
<span class="caption">A TRANSPORT LOADING</span>
</div>

<p>'Hustle'&mdash;as once he told us&mdash;is the superintendent's maiden name. Already
the narrow water-space between us and our neighbour is jammed tight by laden
barges, brought in to await our coming. Billets of steel, rough-cast shells, copper
ingots, bars of lead and zinc are piled ready for acceptance. The shed on our
inshore tide is packed by lighter and more perishable cargo, all standing to hand
for shipment. Preparation for our rapid dispatch is manifest and complete.
Before the pilot is off the ship with his docket signed, the blocks of our derricks
are rattling and the stevedores are setting up their gear for an immediate start.
Barred, on the sea-passage, from communication by wireless, we have been unable
to give a timely advice of our condition to the dock. The factor of the coal to
be shifted&mdash;till now unknown to them&mdash;is the first of many difficulties. We
have no cargo to discharge (having crossed in ballast trim), but&mdash;the storms of
the North Atlantic calling for a weight to make us seaworthy&mdash;we have a lading
of coal sufficient to steam us back to our home port. This has all to be raised
from the holds and stowed in the bunker spaces: the holds must be cleaned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
for food-stuffs: for grain in bulk there is carpenter-work in fitting the midship
boards to ensure that our cargo shall not shift. Tuesday morning seems absurdly
near!</p>

<p>With a thud and jar to clear the stiffening of a voyage's inaction, our deck
winches start in to their long heave that shall only end with the closing of the
hatches on a laden cargo. The barges haul alongside at the holds that are ready
for stowage and loading begins. The slings of heavy billets pass regularly across
the deck and disappear into the void of the open hatchways. In the swing and
steady progression there seems an assurance that we shall keep the sailing date,
but our energy is measured by the capacity of the larger holds. In them there
is the bulk of fuel to be handled. The superintendent concentrates the efforts
of his gangs on this main issue: the loading of the smaller compartments is only
useful in relieving the congestion of the barges overside.</p>

<p>Under his direction the coalmen set to work at their hoists and stages and
soon have the baskets swinging with loads from the open hatchways. The coal
thunders down the chutes to the waiting barges, and raises a smother of choking
dust. The language of South Italy rings out in the din and clatter. "Veera,
veera," roars the stageman (not knowing that he is passing an ancient order on
a British ship). It is a fine start. Antonio and Pasquali and their mates are
fresh: they curse and praise one another alternately and impartially: they
seem in a fair way to earn their tonnage bonus by having the holds cleared before
the morning.</p>

<p>It is almost like an engagement in arms. Good leadership is needed. There
are grades and classes in the army of dockers; groups as clearly specialized in
their work as the varied units that form an army corps. Italian labourers handle
the coal; coloured men are employed for the heavy and rough cargo work; the
Irish are set to fine stowage. There is little infringement of the others' work.
Artillery and infantry are not more set apart in their special duties than the
grades of the dockers. Certainly there is a rivalry between the coloured men
and the Irish&mdash;the line that divides the cargo is perhaps lightly drawn. "Hey!
You nigger! You gitta hell out o' this," says Mike. The coloured man bides
his time. The thunder of the winches pauses for an instant&mdash;he shouts down
the hatchway: "Mike! Ho, Mike!" An answering bellow sounds from below.
"Ah say, Mike! When yo' gwine back hom' t' fight fo' King Gawge?"</p>

<p>Sunday morning, the 'macaroni' gangs knock off work for a term. The holds
are cleared, but our fuel has again to be hove up from the barges and stowed in
the bunkers. That can be done while loading is in progress. Meantime&mdash;red-eyed
and exhausted&mdash;the coalmen troop ashore and leave the ship to one solitary
hour of Sunday quiet. At seven the turmoil of what the superintendent calls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
a 'fair start' begins. Overnight a floating-tower barge for grain elevation has
joined the waiting list of our attendant lighters. She warps alongside and turns
her long-beaked delivery-pipes on board; yellow grain pours through and spreads
evenly over the floor-space of our gaping holds. Fore and aft we break into a
full measure of activity. The loading of the cargo is not our only preparation
for the voyage. The fittings of the 'tween-decks, thrown about in disorder by
the coal-gangs, have to be reconstructed and the decks made ready for troops.
Cleaning and refitting operations go on in the confusion of cargo work: conflicting
interests have to be reconciled&mdash;the more important issues expedited&mdash;the
fret of interfering actions turned to other channels. At the shore end of the
gangways there is riot among the workers. Stores and provisions are delivered
by the truckmen with an utter disregard for any convenience but their own.
The narrow roadway through the shed is blocked and jammed by horse and
motor wagons that, their load delivered, can find no way of egress. Cargo work
on the quayside comes to a halt for want of service. The dockers roar abuse
at the truckmen, the truckmen&mdash;in intervals of argument with their fellows&mdash;return
the dockers' obloquy with added embellishment. The 'house-that-Jack-built'
situation is cleared by the harassed pier-foreman. The shed gates are
drawn across: outside the waiting charioteers stand by, their line extended to
a block on the Twenty-Third Street cars.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The roar and thrust and rattle of the straining winches ceases on Monday
evening. We are fully stowed: even our double-bottom tanks&mdash;intended for
water-ballast alone&mdash;carry a load of fuel oil to help out the difficulties of transport.
The superintendent goes around with his chest thrown out and draws
our attention to the state of affairs&mdash;the ship drawing but eighteen inches short
of her maximum draught, and the 'tween-decks cleared and fitted. "Fifty-four
working hours, capt'n," he says proudly. It is no mean work!</p>

<p>The silence of the ship, after the din and uproar of our busy week-end, seems
uncanny. The dock is cleared of all our attendant craft, and the still backwater
is markedly in contrast to the churned and troubled basin that we had known.
From outside the dock a distant subdued murmur of traffic on the streets comes
to us. Cross-river ferries cant into a neighbouring slip, and the glow of their
brilliant lights sets a reflection on the high facades of the water-front buildings.
Overhead, the sky is alight with the warm irradiance of the great city. Ship-life
has become quiescent since the seamen bundled and put away their gear
after washing decks. Only the dynamos purr steadily, and an occasional tattoo
on the stokehold plates tells of the firemen on duty to raise steam. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
unfamiliar quiet of the night and absence of movement in the dock there is
countenance to a mood of expectancy. It seems unreasonable that we should
so lie idle after the past days of strenuous exertion in preparing for sea. The
flood in the North River, dancing under the waterside lights, invites us out to
begin the homeward voyage. Why wait?</p>

<p>We are not yet ready. In our lading we have store of necessities to carry
across the sea. Food, munitions and furniture of war, copper, arms, are packed
tightly in the holds: power-fuel for our warships lies in our tanks. There is
still a further burthen to be embarked&mdash;we wait a cargo of clear-headed, strong-limbed,
young citizens bound east to bear arms in the Crusade.</p>

<p>They come after midnight. There are no shouts and hurrahs and flag-waving.
A high ferry-boat crosses from the west shore and cants into the berth alongside
of us. The dock shed, now clear of goods, is used for a final muster. Encumbered
by their heavy packs, they line out to the gangways and march purposely
on board. The high-strung mimicry of jest and light heart that one would have
looked for is absent. There is no boyish call and counter-call to cloak the
tension of the moment. Stolidly they hitch their burdens to an easier posture,
say '<i>yep</i>' to the call of their company officer, and embark.</p>

<p>The troops on board, we lose no time in getting under way. Orders are
definite that we should pass through the booms of the Narrows at daybreak,
and join convoy in the Lower Bay with the utmost dispatch. We back out into
the North River, turn to meet the flood-tide, and steer past the high crown of
Manhattan.</p>

<h3>HOMEWARDS</h3>


<h3><br />THE ARGONAUTS</h3>

<div class='cap'>THE boat guard (one post, section A) stir and grow restive as the hour of
their relief draws on. Till now they have accepted wet quarters, the
reeling ship, black dark night with fierce squalls of rain and sleet, as all
a part of the unalterable purgatory of an oversea voyage. With a prospect
of an end to two hours' spell of acute discomfort, of hot 'kawfee,' dry clothes,
and a snug warm bunk, their spirits rise, and they show some liveliness. Muffled
to the ear-tips in woollens and heavy sodden greatcoats, their rifles slung awkwardly
across the bulge of ill-fitting cork life-belts, they shift in lumbering movement
from foot to foot, or pace&mdash;two steps and a turn&mdash;between the boat-chocks
of their post. A thunder of shattering salt spray lashes over from break of a
sea on the foredeck, and they dodge and dive for such poor shelter as the wing
of the bridge affords.</div>

<p>Scraps of their protest to the fates carry to our post in breaks of the wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
"Aw, you guys! Say! Wisha was back 'n li'l old N'yok, ringin' th' dial 'n a
Twanny-Thoid Street car!" "Whaddya mean&mdash;a Scotch highball? Gee!
I gotta thoist f'r all th' wet we soak!" "Bettcha Heinie's goin'a pay <i>me</i> cents
an' dallers f'r this!" ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an' a job claenin' me roifle.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. th' sargint,
be damn but, he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Cut it! Less talk 'round there!" orders their duty officer from somewhere
in the darkness; the talk ceases, though stamp and bustle of expectant relief
persist, and we are recalled to survey and reflection on the gloom ahead.</p>

<p>Midnight now, and no sign of a change! Anxiously we scan sea and sky
for hope or a promise&mdash;not a token! A squall of driving sleet has passed over,
and has left the outlook moderately clear, but a quick-rising bank of hard clouds
in the nor'east threatens another, and a heavier, by the look, soon to follow.
A moonless night, not a star shines through the sullen upper clouds to mark even
a flying break in the lift of it. A hopeless turn for midnight, showing no relief,
no prospect!</p>

<p>Ahead, the dark bulk of our column leader sways and thrashes through the
spiteful easterly sea, throwing the wash broad out and taking the spray high over
bow and funnel. In turn, we lurch and drive at the same sea that has stirred
her, and find it with strength enough to lash over and fill the fore-deck abrim.
Weighed down forward, we throw our stern high, and the mad propeller thrashes
in air, jarring every bolt and rivet in her. We cant to windward, joggling in an
uneasy lurch, then throw swiftly on a sudden list that frees the decks of the
encumbering water. We ease a pace or two as the propeller finds solid sea
to churn, steady, then gather way to meet the next green wall. With it the
squall breaks and lashes furiously over us, driving the icy slants of hard sleet
to our face, cutting at our eyes in vicious persistence. Joined to the wind-burst,
a heavy sea shatters on fore-end of the bridge, and ring of the steel bulkhead
sounds in with the crash of broken water that floods on us.</p>

<p>In this succession the day and half the night have passed. No 'let-up'
in the round of it. Furious wind-bursts marking time on the face of a steady
gale. Rain&mdash;and now sleet. Sleet! Who ever heard of icy sleet in North
Atlantic, this time of the year? Gad! Every cursed thing seems to weigh in
against us on this voyage! The weather seems in league with the enemy to
baulk our passage. Every cursed thing! Head winds and heavy seas all the
way. Fog! These horse transports having to heave-to, and forcing the rest
of the convoy to head up and mark their damned time! And now this, just
when we were looking for a 'slant' to make the land! Maddening!</p>

<p>The bridge is astir with the change of the watch. A fine job they make of
it! Like a burst of damned schoolboys! Oilskin-clad clumsy ruffians barging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
up the ladders, trampling and stumbling in their heavy sea-boots, across and
about, peering to find their mates! Are they all blind? Why can't they
arrange set posts for eight bells? Why can't they look where&mdash;"Th'
light, damn you! Dowse that light! <i>Huh!</i> Some blasted idiot foul of
that binnacle-screen again! Th' way things are done on this ship! Egad!
Would think we were safe in th' Ship Canal, instead of dodging submar&mdash;&mdash;"
A <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'slatt'">slat</ins> of driving spray cuts over and we dip quickly under edge of the weather-screen.</p>

<p>The second officer arrives to stand his watch, and the Third, who goes below,
is as damnably cheerful and annoying as the other is dour. "North, &mdash;ty-four
east, th' course. She's turning seven-six just now, but you'll have to reduce
shortly&mdash;drawing up on our next ahead. Seven-three or four sh'd keep her
in station. <i>Neleus</i> ahead there, two cables. Rotten weather all th' watch.
Squalls, my hat! There's another big 'un making up now! Th' Old Man
over there&mdash;like a bear with a sore&mdash;raisin' hell 'bout&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, a&mdash;ll right! Needn't make a song and dance of it! North, &mdash;ty-four
east? Right!" Picking up binoculars, the Second scans the black of it
ahead, as though now definitely set for business.</p>

<p>The watch is taken over and all seems settled, but the Third is not yet completely
happy. He gloats a while over the Second's gloomy outlook, and yawns
in that irritating <i>arpeggio</i>, the foretaste of a good sound sleep. "Oh, d'ya read
in orders 'bout th' zigzag for th' morning watch?&mdash;a new stunt, fours and sixes;
start in at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, g'rr out! How can a man keep a watch, you chewin' th' rag? Yes,
I&mdash;read&mdash;the orders!" <i>S-snap!</i></p>

<p>"<i>Huh!</i> A pair of them!" It comes to us that something will have to be
said about the way the damned bridge is relieved in this ship!</p>

<p>Into the chart-room, to fumble awkwardly for light ('<i>T'tt!</i> That switch
out of order again!') and search for a portent in the jeering glassy face of
the aneroid. <i>Tip, tip, whap!</i> The cursed thing is falling still. 'Twenty-nine
owe two&mdash;half an inch since ten o'clock! Whatever can be behind all this?
That damn glass was never right, anyway!'</p>

<span class="caption">THE BOWS OF THE KASHMIR DAMAGED BY COLLISION</span>
</div>

<p>Drumming of the wireless-cabin telephone sounds out, and we listen to a
brief account of Poldhu's war warning. An S.O.S. has been heard, but a shore
station has accepted it. (They can identify the ship&mdash;might be the harping of
a Fritz.) There is a long code message through, and the quartermaster brings it&mdash;a
jumble of helplessly ugly consonants that looks as though the German
Fleet, at last, is out&mdash;but resolves (after a wearisome cryptic wrestle) to back-chat
that has little of interest for us. Poldhu has the reports of the day&mdash;mines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and derelicts, wreckage, the patrols, and enemy submarines in the channels.
Chart work for a while. The wrecks and the derelicts are figured and placed,
and we dally with the subs, plotting and measuring to find a clue to their movements.
'Fifteen hours at six, and ten to come or go! <i>Mmm!</i> That 'll
be the same swine working to the nor'east. Hope he makes a good course
into the minefield! This one is solo&mdash;and that! A ghastly bunch, anyway!'
We project a line of our course, but hesitate at position. 'Not one decent
observation in the last three days. Only a muggy guess at a horizon. Dead-reckoning?
Of course, there is our dead-reckoning, but&mdash;but&mdash;wonder where
the commodore got his position from? Must have added on th' day of th'
month, or fingers and toes or something! Damned if we can see how, at twelve
knots, we could be where&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The outspread chart, glaring white under the electric light, with a maze
of heights and soundings, grows strangely indistinct, and it calls for an effort
to set the counts and figures in their places. We realize that wandering thought
and a warm chart-room are not the combination for wakefulness. So, on deck
again, to steady up at the doorway and wonder why the night has become
suddenly as hellish black as the pit!</p>

<p>The second officer has found his composure at the bottom of a cup of steaming
coffee, and seems mildly astonished that we are unable to pick up <i>Neleus</i> in
the darkness ahead. "Quite plain, sir, when these squalls pass. A bit murky
while they blow over, but&mdash;see her clear enough, sir. Reduced two revolutions,
and keeping good station on her at that!" Somewhat slowly (for we have
been afoot since six yesterday morning) our eyes focus to the gloom and line
out the sea and sky in their shaded proportions. <i>Neleus</i> grows out of the sombre
opacous curtain&mdash;a definite guide with the sea breaking white in her wake.
Dark patches of smoke-wrack, around and about, mark bearings on the sea-line
where our sisters of the convoy are forging through. The next astern has
dropped badly in cleaning fires, and is now throwing a whirl of green smoke
in the effort to regain her station. The sea seems to have lessened since last
we viewed it. Our hot coffee may have had effect in producing a more impressionable
frame of mind, but certainly the weather is no worse. The rain
and sleet have beaten out a measure of the toppling sea-crests. We see the forecastle-head,
black and upstanding, for longer periods, and only broken spray
flies over, where, but a little ago, were green whelming seas. A sign of modest
content comes from the boat-deck, where the guards are humming, "<i>Over
there, over there, over there! Th' Yanks are coming!</i>"</p>

<p>The duty officer (troops) comes to us to pass the time of the morning. He
salutes with punctilio. (He has not yet learned that we are only a damn civilian,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
camouflaged, and not entitled to such respect.) It is reported to him that one
of the ship's boats had been badly damaged by a sea during the night. "In
event of&mdash;of an accident, is it in orders that the troops allocated [his word]
to that boat shall not go in any other?"</p>

<p>Good lad! For all that darkness and the gale, he looks very fine and bold,
standing stiffly, if somewhat unsteadily, demanding detail of the Birkenhead
Drill! We assure him that there will be no immediate need for regrouping
the men, that measures have already been taken to repair the damaged planking,
that half an hour of daylight will serve us&mdash;and turn the talk to less disquieting
affairs. He is very keen. Till now he has never been farther out to sea than
the Iron Steamboat Company would take him&mdash;to Coney Island or the more
subdued delights of the Hook. A New-Yorker, he tempers quite natural vaunts
to be the more in keeping with the great and impending trial that awaits. For
all that, he is gravely concerned that we should recognize his men as good and
true&mdash;"the best ever, yessa!" With a good experience of their conduct,
under trying conditions, we assent.</p>

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They kin number us up all they wanna, but we're the&mdash;th N' Yok
National Guard&mdash;a right good team! Down there on th' Mexican barder, we
sure got trimmed, good and planny! Hot! My! Saay, cap'n, I guess&mdash; Ah
well, a' course you've been through some heat, too&mdash;but it was sure some
warm hell down there! Yes&mdash;sir!" A bright lad!</p>

<p>His words recall to us a windy afternoon on Fifth Avenue, in the days when
our Uncle Sam was dispassionate and neutral. Flags whipping noisily in the
high breeze, the crowds, the bands, and the long khaki column in fours winding
towards the North River ferries to embark for Mexico, on a task that called
for inhuman restraint. Newsboys were shouting aloud the peril of Verdun,
and the thought came to us then&mdash;"Will that stream of manhood ever march
east?" And now, under our feet and in our charge, fourteen hundred&mdash;"the
best ever, yessa!"&mdash;are bound east by every thrust of the screw, and out on
the heaving waste of water around us are fifteen thousand more; and the source
is sure, and the stream, as yet, is but trickling.</p>


<h3><br />ON OCEAN PASSAGE</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> weather has certainly moderated. In but an hour the sea has gone
down considerably. There is no longer height enough in the tumble of it to
throw us about like a Deal lugger. We steam on a more even keel; the jar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and racket of the racing propeller has altered to a steady rhythmic pulse-beat
that thrusts our length steadily through the water. At times the rain lashes
over and shuts out sight of our neighbours, but we have opportunity to regulate
our station in the lengthening intervals between the squalls. Improvement
in the wind and sea has brought our somewhat scattered fleet into better and
closer order. The rear horse-transports have come up astern and seem to have
got over the steering difficulties that their high topsides and small rudder-immersion
effected in the heavier sea. Only the barometer shows no inclination
to move, in keeping with the better conditions&mdash;the rain, perhaps, is keeping the
mercury low.</div>

<p>It seems plain sailing for a while. The Second can look out for her; no
use having too many good men on the bridge. We are only in the way out here,
stamping and turning on the wet foot-spars, or throwing bowlines in the
'dodger' stops to pass the night. Four bells&mdash;two a.m.&mdash;the time goes slowly!
We are somewhat footsore. Perhaps, sea-boots off, a seat for a minute or two
in the chart-room may ease our limbs for the long day that lies before us.</p>

<p>A long day, and the best part of another long day before we reach port!
A wearisome stretch of it! We ought to have some system of relief. Why not?
Why not take a relief? The chief officer is as good a man as the master. Why
not let him run the bus for a spell? Oh, just&mdash;just&mdash;just a rotten way we
have of doing! In the Navy they make no bones about turning over to their
juniors; why should we make it so hard for our&mdash; "<i>Says it is hazy, sir!
Told me to let you know he hasn't seen any of the ships for over an hour!</i>"</p>

<p>Whatever is the man talking about! "<i>Ships?</i>" What ships? "<i>An
hour?</i>"</p>

<p>The quartermaster, in storm-rig of dripping oilskin, stands sheepish in the
doorway. "Aff-past-three, sir," he says.</p>

<p>"<i>Htt!</i>" In drowsy mood we don oilskin and sea-boots. Overhead the rain
is drumming, heavy and persistent, on the deck. A glance at the barometer
shows an upward spring. <i>Tip, tip, tip</i>&mdash;a good glass, that! Well-balanced!
The Second is apologetic, almost as though his was the hand that had accidentally
turned the tap. "Been like this for over an hour, sir! Was always hoping
it would pass off, but there has been no sign of clearing. Would have called you
sooner, but thought it would lift. I've kept her steady at average revolutions
for the last eight hours' run&mdash;seven-three. Haven't seen a thing since shortly
after you went below." A query brings answer that the fog-buoy has been
streamed and gun's crew cautioned to a sharp look-out astern. Not that there
is great need; our sailing experience has been that A&mdash;&mdash; will drop astern when
'the gas is turned down!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind has fallen and has hauled to south. It is black dark, with a heavy
continuous downpour of rain. The air is milder, and the sea around has a glow
of luminous milky patches. So, it is to be southerly weatherly for making the
land! It might be worse! At least, this thrash of heavy rain will 'batten
hatches' on a rise of the sea, and make a good parade-ground for our destroyer
escort when they join company. We should be able to shove along at better
speed when daylight comes. The mist or the haze or whatever combination
it may be, is puzzling. From the outlook it is not easy to gauge the range of
our vision. Near us the wash from our bows is sharply defined by phosphorescence
in the broken water, a white scum churns and curls alongside, brightening
suddenly in patches as though our passage had set spark to the fringe. Outboard
the open sea merges away into the gloomy sky with no horizon, no ruling
of a division. We seem to be steaming into a vertical face of vapour. There is
no sound from the ships around us, not a light glimmers in the darkness. The
eerie atmosphere through which we pass has effect on the night-life of the ship.
On deck there is an inclination to move quietly, to preserve a silence in keeping
with the weird spell that seems to environ us. There is no longer chatter and
small talk among the duty troops; they sit about, huddled in glistening <i>ponchos</i>,
peering out at the ghostly glow on the water. From far down in the bowels
of the ship the rattle of a stoker's shovel on the plates rings out in startling
clamour, and rouses an instant desire to suppress the jarring note. It seems
impossible that there can be ships in our company&mdash;vessels moving with us
through mystic seas. We peer around, on all the bearings, but see nothing
on our encircling wall. Smell? We nose at the air, seeking a waft of coal-smoke,
but the rain is beating straight down, basting the funnel-wraiths on the
flat of the sea.</p>

<p>An average of eight hours' steaming, seven-three revolutions, may be no good
guide, considering the racing and the plunging we have gone through. In proper
station we ought to see the loom of <i>Neleus</i> ahead, or, at least, the wash of her
fog-buoy. It is important that we should be in good touch at daybreak. We
go full speed for a turn or two and post an officer in the bows to scan for our leader.</p>

<p>New and vexing problems come at us as time draws on. We are due to start
a zigzag, 'in execution of previous orders,' before the day breaks. We see
a royal 'hurrah's nest'&mdash;a rough house&mdash;before us if we lay off without a proper
sight of our fellows. So far there has come no negative to our orders; we are
somewhat concerned. A message cannot have been missed, surely! "Nothing
through yet, sir," is the wakeful assurance from the wireless operator. "X's
fierce with this rain, but should get any near message all right."</p>

<p>At eight bells we come in sight of one unit of the convoy. She shows up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
broad off on our lee bow, in a position we had hardly looked for. There is little
to see. A darkling patch, a blurred shadow, in the face of sea and sky, with
a luminous curl of broken water astern. We cannot identify her in the darkness;
flashing signals are barred in the submarine areas; we must wait daylight for
recognition. She should be <i>Neleus</i>, but a hair-line on our steering-card may have
brought us to the leader of the outside column. In any case we are in touch,
and it is with some relief we ease speed to a close approximation of hers. Anon,
our anxiety about the zigzag is dispelled by a message from the commodore,
cancelling former orders. He has sat tight on it to nearly the last minute,
hoping for a clearance.</p>

<p>With the coming of the chief officer's watch we feel that the 'day' is beginning.
Twelve to four are unholy hours that belong to no proper order of our
reckoning. They are past the night, and have no kinship with the day: bitter,
tedious, helpless spaces of time that ought only to be passed in slumber and
oblivion. By five, and the lift greying, there is something in the movement about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the decks that suggests an awakening of the ship to busy life and action, after
the sullen torpor of an uneasy night. The troop 'fatigue men' turn out to
their duties, and traffic to the cooking-galleys goes on, even under the unceasing
downpour that falls on us. The guard get busy on their rounds, challenging
the men as they step out of the companionways, to show their life-belts in
order and properly adjusted. Complaint and discussion are frequent, but the
guard are firm in their insistence. "I should worry!" is the strange request,
appeal, exhortation, demand, reply, aside, that punctuates each meeting on the
decks below. In nowise influenced by the sinister import of the questioning, the
duty troops on the boat-deck waken up. The spirit of matutinal expression
descends on them, despite the rain, and they whistle cheerful 'harmonic discords,'
till barked to silence by Sergeant 'Jawn.'</p>

<p>The watch on deck trail hoses and deck-scrubbers from the racks and set
about preparations for washing down, bent earnestly on their standard rites
though the heavens fall! The carpenter and his mate are assembling their gear
and tools, awaiting better daylight to get on with their repairs to the damaged
lifeboats. On the bridge we seem congested. Extra 'day' look-outs obstruct
our confined gangways and the bulk of their weather harness, plus life-belts and
megaphones, restricts a ready movement. In preparation for busy daylight,
the signalmen put out their bunting on the lettered hooks, and ease off the halyards
that are set 'bar-tight' by the soaking rain. There is, withal, an air
of freshness in the morning bustle that comes in company with the dawn.</p>

<p>With gloom sufficient for our signal needs (and light enough for protection)
we flash a message to our consort. She is <i>Neleus</i>, and answers that she has
other vessels of the convoy in sight to leeward. We sheer into our proper
position astern of her and find the outer column showing through the mist in
good station. On our report that we had no others in sight, <i>Neleus</i> alters course
perceptibly to converge on the commodore, and daylight coming in finds us
steaming in misty but visible touch with the other columns. The horse transports
have dropped astern, and one is bellowing for position. She gets a word
or two on the 'buzzer,' comes ahead, and lets go the whistle lanyard.</p>

<p>If commodore's reckoning is right, we should now be on the destroyer rendezvous,
but our wireless operator, who has been listening to the twitter of the birds,
assures us that they are yet some distance off. We hope for a clearing to enable
them to meet us without undue search; it will not be a simple matter to join
company in the prevailing weather conditions, particularly as we are working
on four days of dead-reckoning. By seven o'clock there is no sign of the small
craft, and we note our ocean escort closing in to engage the commodore with
signals. The rain lessens and turns to a deep Scotch mist, our range of vision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
is narrowed to a length or two. Anon, our advance guardship sets her syren
sounding dismal wails at long intervals, as she swings over from wing to wing
of the convoy.</p>

<p>By what mysterious channel does information get about a ship? Is there a
voice in the aerials? Are ears tuned to the many-tongued whisperings of rivet
and shell-plate, that all hands have an inkling of events? The rendezvous is an
official secret; the coming of the destroyers is supposedly unknown to all but the
master, the navigators, and the wireless operator, but it is not difficult to see a
knowing expectancy in the ranks of our company. Despite the wet and clammy
mist, ignoring the dry comforts of the ''tween-decks,' the troops crowd the
upper passages and hang long over the rails and bulwarks, pointing and shouting
surmise and conjecture to their mates. The crew are equally sensitive. Never
were engine-room and stokehold ventilators so tirelessly trimmed to the wind.
At frequent intervals, one or other of the grimy firemen ascends to the upper
gratings, cranks the cowls an inch or two this way or that, then stands around
peering out through the mist for first sight of a welcome addition to our numbers.
The official ship look-outs are infected by a new keenness, and every vagary in
the wind that exposes a glimpse of our neighbours is greeted by instant hails
from the crow's nest.</p>

<p>Eight bells again! The watch is changed and, with new faces on the bridge,
the length of our long spell is painfully recalled. With something of envy we
note the posts relieved and the men gone below to their hours of rest. "What
a life!" The wail of the guardship's syren fits in to our mood&mdash;<i>Wh-o-o-owe!</i></p>

<p>Quick on the dying note a new syren throws out a powerful reedy blast,
sounding from astern. Thus far on the voyage, with fog so long our portion,
we have come to know the exact whistle-notes of our neighbours, down to the
cough and steam splutter of the older ships. This is new&mdash;a stranger&mdash;a musical
chime that recalls the powerful tug-boats on the Hudson. Our New-Yorker
troops are quick to recognize the homely note. "Aw! Saay!" is the chorus.
"Lissen! Th' <i>Robert E. Lee!</i>  "</p>

<p>The rear ships of the convoy now give tongue&mdash;a medley of confused reverberations.
No reply comes to their tumult, but a line of American destroyers emerges
from the mist astern and steams swiftly between the centre columns. There
is still a long swell on the sea and they lie over to it, showing a broad strake of
composition. They are bedizened in gaudy dazzle schemes, and the mist adds
to the weird effect. The Stars and Stripes flies at each peak, standing out,
board-like, from the speed of their carriers. As they pass, in line ahead, a wild
tumult of enthusiasm breaks out among the troops. They join in a full-voiced
anthem, carried on from ship to ship, "The Star-spangled Banner!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />'ONE LIGHT ON ALL FACES'</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A slight</span> lift in the mist, edging from sou'west in a freshening of the wind,
extends our horizon to include all ships of the convoy. With this modest clearing,
the shield of vapour that has cloaked us from observation since early morning
is withdrawn. Although still hazy, there is sight enough for torpedo range
through a periscope, and the long-delayed zigzag is signalled by the commodore.</div>

<p>There is no time lost in settling to the crazy courses. At rise of the mist
we are steaming through the flat grey sea in parallel columns, our lines ruled
for us by the wakes of our leaders. The contrasts of build and tonnage, the
variegations of our camouflage, are dulled to a drab uniformity by the lingering
mist, and we make a formal set-piece in the seascape, spaced and ordered and
defined. The angle of the zigzag disturbs our symmetry. As one movement,
on the tick of time, we swing over into an apparent confusion, like the flush
of a startled covey. We make a pattern on the smooth sea with our stern wash.
Wave counters wave and sets up a running break on the surface that draws the
eye by its similarity to a sheering periscope; not for the first time we turn our
glasses on the ripples, and scan the spurt of broken water in apprehension.</p>

<p>Our escort is now joined by British sloops returning from their deep-sea
patrols. The faster American destroyers spur out on the wings and far ahead,
leaving the less active warships to trudge and turn in rear of the convoy. With
our new additions, ship by ship steering to the east, we make a formidable international
gathering on the high seas, a powerful fleet bringing the Pilgrim sons
back over the weary sea-route of their fathers' <i>Mayflower!</i>  </p>

<p>Having far-flung scouts to safeguard our passage, there seems no reason for
concern about our navigation, but the habits of a sea-routine urge us to establish
a position&mdash;to right the uncertainty of four days' dead-reckoning. The mist
still hangs persistently about us, but there is a prospect that the sun may break
through. The strength of the wind keeps the upper vapours moving, but ever
there are new banks to close up where a glimpse of clear vision shows a 'pocket'
in the clouds. The westering sun brightens the lift and plays hide-and-seek
behind the filmy strata. Time and again we stand by for an observation, but,
should a nebulous limb of the sun shine through, the horizon is obscured&mdash;when
the sea-line clears to a passable mark, the sun has gone! A vexing round of
trial after trial! We put away the sextant, vowing that no tantalizing promise
shall tempt us. "Bother the sun! 'We should worry!' We have got an
approximation by soundings, we can do without&mdash;we&mdash; <i>Look out, there!</i>"&mdash;we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
are hurrying for the instrument again and tapping 'stand by' to the
marksman at the chronometer!</p>

<p>At length a useful combination of a clean lower limb and a definite horizon
gives opportunity for contact, and it is with a measure of satisfaction we figure
the result on the chart, and work back to earlier soundings for a clue to the
latitude. Busied with pencil and dividers, our findings are disturbed by gunfire&mdash;the
whine of a slow-travelling shell is stifled by a dull explosion that jars the
ship!</p>

<p>On deck again; the men on the bridge have eyes turned to the inner column.
The rearmost transport of that line has a high upheaval of debris and broken
water suspended over her; it settles as we watch, and leaves only a wreath of
lingering dust over the after part of the ship; she falls out of line, listing heavily;
puffs of steam on her whistle preface the signal-blasts that indicate the direction
from which the blow was struck. From a point astern of us a ruled line of disturbed
water extends to the torpedoed ship&mdash;the settling wake of the missile!
The smack and whine of our bomb-thrower speaks out a second time, joined by
other vessels opening fire.</p>

<p>Events have brought our ship's company quickly to their stations. The
chief officer stands, step on the ladder, awaiting orders. "Right! Lay aft!
Cease fire, unless you have a sure target! Look out for the destroyers blanking
the range!" He runs along, struggling through the mass of troops. The
men are strangely quiet; perhaps the steady beat of our engines measures out
assurance to them&mdash;as it does to us. Their white-haired colonel has come
to the bridge, and stands about quietly. Other officers are pushing along to their
stations. There is not more than subdued and controlled excitement in a low
murmur. The men below crowd up the companionways from the troop-decks.
In group and mass, the ship seems packed to overflowing by a drab khaki
swarm; the light on all faces turned on the one cant, arms pointing in one direction,
rouses a haunting disquiet. However gallant and high of heart, they are
standing on unfamiliar ground&mdash;at sea, in a ship, caged! If&mdash;</p>

<p>Two destroyers converge on us at frantic speed, tearing through the flat sea
with a froth in their teeth. As the nearest thunders past, her commander yells
a message through his megaphone. We cannot understand. Busied with
man&oelig;uvres of the convoy, with the commodore's signal for a four-point turn,
we miss the hail, and can only take the swing and wave of his arms as a signal
to get ahead&mdash;"Go full speed!" The jangle of the telegraph is still sounding,
when we reel to a violent shock. The ship lists heavily, every plate and frame
of her ringing out in clamour with the impact of a vicious sudden blow. She
vibrates in passionate convulsion on recovery, masts oscillate like the spring of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a whip-shaft, the rigging jars and rattles at the bolts, a crash of broken glass
showers from the bridge to the deck below!</p>

<p>The murmur among the troops swells to a higher note, there is a crowding
mass-movement towards the boats. The guard is turned to face inboard. The
colonel is impassive; only his eyes wander over the restless men and note the
post of his officers. He turns towards us, inquiringly. What is it to be? His
orderly bugler is standing by with arm crooked and trumpet half raised.</p>

<p>Our lips are framing an order, when a second thundering shock jars the ship,
not less in violence and shattering impact than the first. A high hurtling column
of water shoots up skyward close astern of the ship. We suppress the order
that is all but spoken, stifle the words in our throat. We are not torpedoed!
Depth-charges! The destroyers' work! At a sign, the bugler sounds out
"<i>Still!</i>" and slowly the tumult on deck is arrested.</p>

<p>The commodore's <i>half-right</i> has been instantly acted on, and we are steadied
on a new course, bearing away at full speed, with the torpedoed horse transport
and the racing, circling destroyers astern. Suddenly our bows begin to swing
off to port, falling over towards the outer column. The helmsman has the wheel
hard over against the sheer; we realize that our steering-gear has gone; the
second depth-charge has put us out of control. We swing on the curve of a
gathering impetus&mdash;it is evident that the rudder is held to port; converging
on us at full speed, the rear ship of the outer column steams into the arc of our
disorder!</p>

<p>The signalman is instant with his 'not under command' hoist, the crew
are scattered to throw in emergency gear, but there is no time to arrest the sheer.
The first impulse is to stop and go astern. If we arrest the way of the ship, a
collision is inevitably assured, but the impact may be lessened to a side boarding,
to damage that would not be vital; if we swing as now, we may clear&mdash;our eye
insists we should clear. If our tired eyes prove false, if the strain of a long
look-out has dulled perception, our stem will go clean into her&mdash;we shall cut her
down! Reason and impulse make a riot of our brain. The instinct to haul
back on the reins, to go full astern on the engines, is maddening. Our hand
curves over the brass hood of the telegraph, fingers tighten vice-like on the lever;
with every nerve in tension, we fight the insane desire to ring up and end the
torturing conflict in our mind!</p>

<p>A confusion of minor issues comes crowding for settlement, small stabs to
jar and goad in their trifling. There is a call to carry on side-actions. Every
bell on the bridge clamours for attention. The engine-room rings up, the chief
officer telephones from aft that the starboard chain has parted, the rudder
jammed hard to port. From the upper spars, the signalman calls out a message<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
from an approaching destroyer&mdash;"What is the matter? Are you torpedoed?"
Through all, we swing out&mdash;swiftly, inexorably!</p>

<p>Troops and look-outs scurry off the forecastle-head, in anticipation of a
wrecking blow. On the other ship, there is outcry and excitement. She has
altered course and her stern throws round towards us, further encroaching on
the arc of our man&oelig;uvre. So near we are, we look almost into the eyes of her
captain as we head for the bridge. Troops, the boat-guard, are scrambling
aboard from the out-swung lifeboats, their rifles held high. On her gun-platform
the gunners slam open their breech, withdraw the charge, and hurry forward
to join the mass of men amidships. All eyes are centred on the narrowing space
of clear water that separates us, on our high sheering stem that cuts through
her out-flung side-wash.</p>

<p>Strangely the movement seems to be all in our sweeping bow. The other
vessel appears stationary, inert&mdash;set motionless against the flat background
of misty cloud; our swinging head passes point upon point of the chequered
camouflage on her broadside; subconsciously we mark the colours of her scheme&mdash;red
and green and grey. We clear her line of boats, and sway through the
length of her after-deck&mdash;waver at the stern-house, then cover the grey
mounting of her gun-emplacement. In inches we measure the rails and
stanchions on her quarter, as our upstanding bow drives on. Tensely expectant,
our mind trembles on the crash that seems inevitable.</p>

<p>It does not come. Our eye was right&mdash;we clear her counter! With some
fathoms to spare we sheer over the thrash of her propellers, the horizon
runs a line across our stem, we have clear yielding blue water under the
bows!</p>

<p>The illusion of our sole movement is reversed as the mass of the other vessel
bears away from us. The unbroken sea-line offers no further mark to judge
our swing; we seem to have become suddenly as immobile as a pier-head, while
our neighbour starts from our forefoot in an apparent outrush, closing and opening
the line of her masts and funnels like shutting and throwing wide the panels
of a door.</p>

<p>With no indecision now we pull the lever over hood of the telegraph. One case
is cleared; there still remains the peril of the lurking submarine. The destroyers
are busy on the chase, man&oelig;uvring at utmost speed and exploding depth-charges
in the area. We are now some distance from them but the crash of their explosion
sends an under-running shock to us still. Our sheer has brought us broadside
on to the position from which the enemy loosed off his torpedo. At full astern we
bring up and swing over towards the receding convoy. If we are barred from
carrying on a zigzag by the mishap to our helm, we can still put a crazy gait on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
her by using the engines. Backing and coming ahead, we make little progress,
but at least we present no sitting target.</p>

<p>Reports come through from aft that the broken chain, springing from a fractured
link, has jammed hard under the quadrant; the engineers are at work,
jacking up to release the links; they will be cleared in ten minutes! The
chief asks for the engines to be stopped; sternway is putting purchase on the
binding pressure of the rudder. Reluctantly we bring up and lie-to. In no
mood to advertise our distress, we lower the 'not under command' signals,
and summon what patience may be left to us to await completion of repairs.</p>

<p>A long 'ten minutes!' Every second's tick seems fraught with a new anxiety.
Fearfully we scan the sea around, probing the line of each chance ripple for sight
of an upstanding pin-point. Anon, steam pressure rises and thunders through
the exhaust, throwing a battery of spurting white vapour to the sky, and letting
even the sea-birds know we are crippled and helpless.</p>

<p>The torpedoed ship still floats, though with a dangerous list and her stern
low in the water. A sloop is taking her in tow, and we gather assurance of her
state in the transport's boats still hanging from the davits; they have not
abandoned. She falters at the end of the long tow-rope and sheers wildly in
the wake of her salvor. The convoy has vanished into the grey of the east,
and only a lingering smoke-wreath marks the bearing where they have entered
the mist. The sun has gone, leaving but little afterglow to lengthen twilight;
it will soon be dark. Apparently satisfied with their work the destroyers cease
fire; whether there is oil on their troubled waters we cannot see. They linger
a while, turning, then go on in the wake of the convoy. One turns north towards
us, with a busy windmiller of a signalman a-top the bridge-house. "<i>What is
the matter? Do you wish to be towed?</i>" We explain our case, and receive an
answer that she will stand by, "<i>but use utmost dispatch effect repair</i>."</p>

<p>'Use utmost dispatch'! With every minute, as the time passes, goes our
chance of regaining our station in the convoy; we are in ill content to linger!
We have a liking for our chief engineer&mdash;a respect, an admiration&mdash;but never
such a love as when he comes to the bridge-ladder, grimy, and handling his scrap
of waste. "They're coupling up now! A job we had! Chain jammed and
packed under th' quadrant, like it had been set by a hydraulic ram! If that
one landed near Fritz, he'll trouble us no more!"</p>

<span class="caption">EVENING: THE MERSEY FROM THE LANDING-STAGE</span>
</div>

<p>With the engines turning merrily, and helm governance under our hand,
we regain composure. Our task is yet none too easy. Even at our utmost
speed we cannot now rejoin the convoy before nightfall; snaking through the
ships in the dark to take up station offers another harassing night out!
Still, it might be worse&mdash;much worse! We think of the torpedoed ship towing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
so slowly abeam&mdash;of the khaki swarm on our decks, 'the light on all faces
turned on one cant.' Surely our luck is in! The infection of the measured
beat in our progress recalls a job unfinished; we step into the chart-room and
take up pencil and dividers.</p>

<h3>'DELIVERING THE GOODS'</h3>


<div class='cap'>OCTOBER on the Mersey is properly a month of hazy autumn weather,
but the few clear days seem to gain an added brilliance from their
rarity, and present the wide estuary in a vivid, clear-cut definition.
The distant hills of North Wales draw nearer to the city, and stand over the
slated roofs of the Cheshire shore as though their bases were set in the peninsula.
Seaward the channel buoys and the nearer lightships are sharply distinct, cutting
the distant sea-line like the topmast spars of ships hull down. Every ripple
and swirl of the tide is exaggerated by the lens of a rare atmosphere; the bow
wash of incoming vessels is thrown upward as by mirage.</div>

sloops of the escort steam quickly between the channel buoys and pass in by
New Brighton at a clip that shows their eagerness to complete the voyage. A
sloop detaches from the flotilla and rounds-to off the landing-stage. Her decks
are crowded by men not of her crew. Merchant seamen are grouped together
at the stern, and a small body of Uncle Sam's coloured troops line the bulwarks
in attitudes of ease and comfort. They are a happy crowd, and roar jest and
catchword to the passengers on the crossing ferries. The merchantmen are less
boisterous. They watch the preparations of the bluejackets for mooring at the
stage with a detached professional interest; some of them gaze out to the
nor'ard where the transports of the convoy are approaching. Doubtless their
thoughts are with the one ship missing in the fleet&mdash;their ship. The sloop hauls
alongside the stage and a gangway is passed aboard. Naval transport officers
and a major of the U.S. Army staff are waiting, and engage the commander of
the man-of-war in short conversation. The men are disembarked and stand
about in straggling groups. There is little to be said by the sloop's commander.
"A horse transport torpedoed yesterday. No! No losses. Tried to tow her
for a bit, but had to cast off. She went down by the stern."</p>

<p>The trooper horse-tenders are marshalled in some order and pass over to the
waiting-rooms under charge of the American officer. With a word or two and a
firm handshake to the sloop's commander, the master of the torpedoed ship
comes ashore and joins his men. No word of command! He jerks his head in
the direction of the Liver Buildings and strides off. The seamen pick up their
few bundles of sodden clothing and make after him, walking in independent and
disordered groups. As they straggle along the planking of the stage, a military
band&mdash;in full array&mdash;comes marching down from the street-way. They step
out in fine swing, carrying their glittering brasses. "Here, Bill," says one of
the seamen, hitching his shoulder towards the burdened drummers, "who said
we was too late for th' music!"</p>

<p>The transports have come into the river. Every passing tug and ferry-boat
gives <i>rrr&mdash;oot</i> on her steam-whistle to welcome them as they round-to off the
docks and landing-stage. Loud bursts of cheer and answering cheer sound over
the water. The wide river, so lately clear of shipping, seems now narrowed to
the breadth of a canal by the huge proportions of the liners bringing up in the
tideway. The bizarre stripes and curves and the contrasted colours of their
dazzle schemes stand out oddly against the background of the Cheshire shore. It
is not easy to disentangle the lines of the ships in the massed grouping of funnel
and spar and high topsides. They are merged into a bewildering composition
with only the mastheads and the flags flying at the trucks to guide the eye in
attempting a count. Fifteen large ships, brimming at the bulwarks with a packed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
mass of troops, all at a deep draught that marks their load below decks of food
and stores and munitions.</p>

<p>The landing-stage becomes rapidly crowded by disembarkation officers and
their staffs. Transport wagons and cars arrive at the south end and run quietly on
the smooth boarding to their allotted stands. A medical unit, gagged with fearsome
disinfectant pads, musters outside their temporary quarters. Most prominent
of all, tall men in their silver and blue, a sergeant and two constables of
the City police stand by&mdash;the official embodiment of law and order.</p>

<p>A flag is posted by the stage-men at the north end, and its flutter calls an
answering whistle-blast from the nearest transport. Steadily she disengages from
the press of ships and closes in towards the shore. The tugs guiding her sheer
strain at the hawsers and lie over in a cant that shows the tremendous weight
of their charge. A row-boat dances in the wash of their screws as it is backed
in to the liner's bows to pass a hawser to the stage. Sharp, short blasts indicate
the pilot's orders from the bridge: the stage-master keeps up a commentary
on the man&oelig;uvres through a huge megaphone. Stir and bustle and high-spirited
movement! The troops that pack the liner's inshore rails give tongue
to excited gaiety. A milkgirl (slouch hat, trousers and gaiters complete)
passes along the stage on her way to the restaurant and is greeted with
acclaim, "Thatta gel&mdash;thatta goil&mdash;oh, you kid!" The policemen come in
for it: "Aw, say! Looka th' guys 'n tha lodge trimmings. What's th' secret
sign, anyway!" An embarrassed and red-faced junior of the Transport Service
is forced to tip it and accept three cheers for "th' Brissh Navy!"</p>

<p>The opening bars of 'The Star-spangled Banner' brings an instant stop to
their clamour. The troops spring to attention in a way that we had not observed
before in their own land. The spirit of patriotism, pronounced in war! 'God
Save the King' keeps them still at attention. As strong as war and patriotism&mdash;the
spirit of a new brotherhood in arms!</p>

<p>The transport makes fast and high gantries are linked to a position on the
stage and their extensions passed on board. The stage-men make up their
heaving-lines and move off to berth a second vessel at the south end. The tide
is making swiftly in the river, and there must be no delay if the troops are to
be disembarked and the ships cast off in time to dock before high water has
passed.</p>

<span class="caption">TROOP TRANSPORTS DISEMBARKING AT THE LANDING-STAGE, LIVERPOOL</span>
</div>

<p>Viewed from the low tidal stage, almost at a level with the water, the ship&mdash;that
had appeared so delicate of line in the river&mdash;assumes a new and stronger
character at close hand. The massive bulk of her, towering almost overhead,
dwarfs the surrounding structures. The shear that gave her beauty at a distance
is lost in the rapid foreshortening of her length: her weathered plating, strake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
upon strake bound by a pattern of close rivet-work, attracts the eye and imposes
an instant impression of strength and seaworthiness. On her high superstructure
the figures of men seem absurdly diminished. The sense of their control of such
a vessel is difficult of realization. Pouring from her in an apparently endless
stream of khaki, her living cargason passes over the gangways.</p>

<p>They move rapidly from the ship to the shore. Waiting-sheds and the upper
platforms are soon littered by their packs and equipment, and the troops squat
on the roadway to await formation of their group. Large bodies are marched
directly to the riverside station to entrain for camp, but the assortment and
enumeration of most of the companies and detachments is carried through on
the broad planking of the stage. In and out the mustered files of men, transport
cars make a noisy trumpeting progress, piled high with baggage and stores, and
each crowned by a waving party of high-spirited soldiers. A second transport
is brought in at the other end of the stage, and adds her men to the throng of
troops at the water-side. The disembarkation staff have work with the sheep
and the goats. There is the natural desire to learn how 'th' fellers' got on in
the other ship, and the two ships' complements are mixed in a fellowship that
makes a tangle of the 'nominal rolls' and drives the harassed officers to an outburst
of profanity. Ever and on, a block occurs on the gangways where the
inevitable 'forgetters' are struggling back through the press of landing men,
to search for the trifles of their kit.</p>

<p>A prolonged blast of her siren warns the military officers that the first transport
is about to cast off, and the movement of the troops is accelerated to a hurried
rush and the withdrawal of the gangways. The waiting tugs drag the ship from
the stage, and she moves slowly down-stream to dock at the Sandon entrance,
there to discharge the burden of her packed holds. Another huge vessel takes her
place, canting in at the north end, and shortly sending out more men to the
already congested landing. She carries two full battalions, and they are disembarked
with less confusion than the former varied details. Forming fours,
and headed by their own band, they march off up the long bridgeway to the
city streets.</p>

<p>The tide is approaching high water and the pilots are growing anxious lest
they should lose opportunity of docking on the tide. Already the dock gates
are open, and the smaller vessels of the convoy have dropped out of the river
into the basins. With three ships disembarked and a fourth drawing alongside,
the Naval Transport officers decide that they can handle no more men on the
stage, and send the remaining steamers to land their men in dock. There, with
the troops away, an army of dockers can get to work to unload the store of
their carriage from overseas.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<h3>'M N'</h3>


<div class='cap'>SHIMMERING in gilt sunlit threads, the grey North Sea lay calm and
placid, at peace with the whip of the winds after days of storm and
heavy weather. The sun had come up to peer over a low curtain of
vapour that hung in the east. Past the meridian, the moon stood clear-cut in
the motionless upper sky. The ring of quiet sea accepted the presence of the
waiting ships as of friendly incomers, familiar to the round of the misty horizon.
Two British destroyers, a flotilla of motor-vessels, drifters&mdash;the brown sails of
Thames barges appearing, then vanishing, in the wisps of fickle vapour. A breathless
dawn. Sun, the silver moon, the grey flat sea bearing motionless ships,
were witness to the drama&mdash;the giving up of the murder craft, the end of piracy.</div>

<p>Growing out of the mist, a squadron of British light cruisers and their convoy
approached the rendezvous where the destroyers lay in readiness to take over
charge of the German submarines. Two enemy transports under their commercial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
flags, headed the line of the water-snakes. Aircraft circled overhead
and turned and returned on the line of progress. The leading ships swung
out on approaching the destroyers and engaged them by signal. The
destroyers weighed anchor and proceeded to carry out their orders. Each
carried a number of officers and men to be placed aboard the submarines, to
accept their surrender, to direct their further passage to within the booms at
Harwich.</p>

<p>The commander of <i>Melampus</i> focused his glasses on the eleventh submarine
of the long straggling line. The U-boat had a wash over his screws and was
apparently steaming ahead to overtake his fellows, now fading into the mist in
the direction of their prison gates.</p>

<p>"Our group," he said: then, to the signalman, "Tell him to stop instantly!"</p>

<p>The bluejacket stood out on the sparring of the bridge and signalled with
his hand-flags. The submarine still moved ahead at speed, his exhaust panting
at pressure. The German commander could not (or would not) understand, and
it was necessary to hoist 'M N' of the International Code. The two flags were
sufficient: he threw his engines astern and brought up to await further orders.
His followers arrived on the station. Some cast anchor, others slowed and
stopped. All took note of the flags&mdash;St. Andrew's cross over blue and white
checquers, hoisted at the destroyer's yard-arm&mdash;and obeyed the summary signal.</p>

<p>'M N!' International Code! The old flags of the days when there was
peace on the sea, when the German commercial ensign was known and familiar
and respected in the seaports of the world!</p>

<p>How many of the Germans would understand the full significance of the hoist
that brought them to a standstill&mdash;the import of the flags drooping in the windless
air&mdash;the beckoning of the coloured fabric that ended their murder trade. The
day had long passed since they had used this warning signal for a procedure in
law and order. No 'M N' to <i>Lusitania</i> before littering the Irish Sea with
wreckage and the pitiful bodies of women and small children: no signal to
<i>Arabic</i> or <i>Persia:</i>   no warning to <i>Belgian Prince</i>, to <i>California</i>, to all the long
and ghastly list: no summons to the hospital ships&mdash;alight and blazoned to
advertise their humane mission. And now&mdash;their ensign dishonoured, their
name as seamen condemned to the everlasting tale of infamy, their proud commercial
seafaring destroyed&mdash;to come in with the blood on their hands, and
render and submit to the mandate of a two-flag hoist!</p>

<p>'M N!' The Code of the Nations! The summons to peaceful seafarers!
'Stop instantly!' Disobey at your peril! At last, at long last, the Freedom
of the Seas&mdash;the security of the ships&mdash;the safety of all who pass on their lawful
occasions&mdash;completely re-established by the flaunt of the old flags!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>


<div class='cap'>COMPELLED by the nature of their work to be long absent from home
ports, seamen are frequently in ignorance of the current of longshore
opinion. Newspapers do not reach out to the sea-routes (as yet), and
the media of Guild Gazettes and Association Reporters come somewhat late on
the tide of an appreciation. The tremendous historical importance of the
Nation's Thanks to its Fighting Forces (in which the Merchants' Service was
included) has not adequately been realized by the merchantmen. Some do not
even know of it. For these reasons&mdash;not in a spirit of 'pride above desert'&mdash;the
writer quotes the following:</div>

<p>The Resolution of Parliament of October 29, 1917, placed upon record&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That the thanks of this House be accorded to the officers and men
of the Mercantile Marine for the devotion to duty with which they have
continued to carry the vital supplies to the Allies through seas infested with
deadly perils."</p></div>

<p>A year later, an equally generous appreciation of the work of the Merchants'
Service was issued by the Board of Admiralty.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On the occasion of the first Meeting of the Board of Admiralty after
the signing of the German Armistice, their Lordships desire, on behalf of
the Royal Navy, to express their admiration and thanks to the Owners,
Masters, Officers, and Crews of the British Mercantile Marine, and to those
engaged in the Fishing Industry, for the incomparable services which they
have rendered during the War, making possible and complete the Victory
which is now being celebrated.</p>

<p>"The work of the Mercantile Marine has been inseparably connected
with that of the Royal Navy, and without the loyal co-operation of the
former, the enemy's Submarine Campaign must inevitably have achieved
its object. The Mercantile Marine from the beginning met this unprecedented
form of warfare with indomitable courage, magnificent endurance,
and a total disregard of danger and death, factors which the enemy had
failed to take into account and which went far towards defeating his object.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"In no small measure also has the success achieved against the submarine
been due to the interest taken by Owners in the defensive equipment of
their ships, and to the ability, loyalty, and technical skill displayed by
Masters and Officers in carrying out Admiralty regulations which, though
tending to the safety of the vessels from submarine risks, enormously
increased the strain and anxiety of navigation. The loyal observance of
these precautions has been the more commendable since the need for absolute
secrecy, on which safety largely depended, has prevented the reasons for
their adoption being in all cases disclosed.</p>

<p>"Further, the Convoy System, which has played such an important
part in frustrating the designs of the enemy and securing the safe passage
of the United States Army, could never have attained its success but for
the ability and endurance displayed by Masters, Officers, and crews of the
Merchant Service forming these Convoys. This system has called for the
learning and practising of a new science&mdash;that of station-keeping&mdash;the
accuracy of which has depended in no small measure on the adaptability
and skill of the Engineers and their Departments.</p>

<p>"Their Lordships also desire to acknowledge the ready response of
Owners to the heavy calls made on the Merchant Service for Officers and
men to meet the increasing requirement of the Navy. On board our ships
of every type, from the largest Dreadnought down to the smallest Patrol
Boat are to be found Officers and men of the Merchant Navy who have
combined with those of the Royal Navy in fighting the enemy and defeating
his nefarious methods of warfare at sea.</p>

<p>"The Merchant Service and the Royal Navy have never been so closely
brought together as during this War. In the interests of our glorious
Empire this connection must prove a lasting one."</p></div>

<div class='unindent'>The Resolution of Parliament of August 6, 1919, placed upon record&mdash;</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That the thanks of this House be accorded to the officers and men of
the Mercantile Marine for the fine and fearless seamanship by which our
people have been preserved from want and our cause from disaster."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Obvious punctuation errors repaired.</p>
<p>Text uses both propeller and propellor. Varied hyphenation where a majority
usage could not be confirmed within the text was retained. For example: three
uses of seamen and two of sea-men.</p>

<p>Page 259, the reference to page 136 was removed as this is a blank page following an illustration.
